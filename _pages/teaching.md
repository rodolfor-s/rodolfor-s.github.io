## Course overview

***Description***

We introduce formal theorem proving with the Lean 4 programming language, placing emphasis on developing Quantum Information Theory theorems and proofs. Formal proof writing is an increasingly important skill as Quantum Information grows more sophisticated, and as machine-verification tools gain popularity.

Participants will learn core theorem-proving syntax, the basics of Lean’s own type theory, the notion and use of tactics, and will gain familiarity with the Mathlib and Physlib/QuantumInfo libraries.

***List of main topics:***
- Formal theorem proving in Lean 4
- Machine-verified mathematics for quantum information theory
- Core theorem-proving syntax
- Lean type theory and tactics
- Mathlib and Physlib/QuantumInfo libraries

***Goals***

Learn the ability
- to set up a Lean repository from scratch,
- to assess the quality of AI-written Lean code,
- to reason about mathematics using code,
- to understand the role of logical verification and its significance in today's mathematics research landscape.

## Assessment & project suggestions

A final project that ties together Lean with quantum information and/or physics.

### Library-contribution suggestions

Projects aimed at concrete and more targeted proofs can be found in Physlib as well as in the QuantumInfo sublibrary. See below a set of resources for you to find how to contribute. Reach out to me for planning around what exactly to do.

- See **[Getting started](https://physlib.io/getting-started)** and **[Get involved](https://physlib.io/get-involved)** onboarding pages for new contributors.
- **[Open issues](https://github.com/leanprover-community/physlib/issues)** in Github are results of interest, tagged `good first issue`, `help-wanted`, `API` (more structural than theorem-proving-focused), and `formalization` (a specific theorem requested for formalization).
- **[Project-wide TODO list for Physlib](https://physlib.io/todo)**.
- **[QuantumInfo TODO](https://github.com/leanprover-community/physlib/blob/master/docs/WildeTODO.md)**: formalize Mark Wilde's *Quantum Information Theory*, marking each definition/exercise/theorem as done, stated but unproved, or not yet formalized. “Not yet formalized” are textbook results that fit this project.
- Contributions are reviewed at two tiers: [**Physlib**](https://github.com/leanprover-community/physlib/tree/master/Physlib) high-standard review, and [**PhyslibAlpha**](https://github.com/leanprover-community/physlib/tree/master/PhyslibAlpha) with a lighter review process.

### Research interest suggestions (by postdocs and visitors at Perimeter)

The aim of the suggestions below is less about having one concluded proof end-to-end, which may be too difficult given the scope of the project and the time available for the course.

Instead, an interested student can try to tackle this problem by developing and proposing a “roadmap” of definitions and theorems, building the infrastructure to allow the formalization of the results below.

**Simon Langenscheidt**: In 3D Euclidean Quantum Gravity, we can traditionally represent the path integral over geometries by a discretised sum over triangulated spacetimes. The geometries then are labels attached to the triangulations, and the sum is referred to as a state sum or spin foam model. The most well understood one is the Turaev-Viro model, which has the special property of giving a triangulation invariant, finite sum. In this way, it defines the data for a TQFT. Show, along the lines of the paper by [Barrett and Crane](https://doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/14/8/011), that this model is indeed triangulation independent and finite.

A list from **Yaroslav Herasymenko** (adapted text):
- **NLTS theorem** ([Anshu–Breuckmann](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13228)), which follows from the existence of good quantum LDPC codes. Alternatively, have the implementations of those codes as the target.
- **Unique-games hardness of approximating Max-Cut beyond the Goemans–Williamson ratio** ([Khot, Kindler, Mossel & O'Donnell](https://doi.org/10.1137/S0097539705447372)).
- **"Average symmetry" de Finetti theorem** ([Brandão–Harrow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0017)): a rigorous mean-field result with applications to approximation algorithms.
- **Howe duality** (advanced): a representation-theory-heavy topic.

**Vania Vellucci**: Formal verification of the sharp Buchdahl–Andréasson compactness bound. The theorem is relevant to strong gravity because it gives a sharp, largely matter-model-independent obstruction within General Relativity to constructing arbitrarily compact static horizonless objects. [H. Andréasson](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jde.2008.05.010), “Sharp bounds on \(2m/r\) of general spherically symmetric static objects”. The original isotropic result is [H. A. Buchdahl](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.116.1027), “General Relativistic Fluid Spheres,”.

Second suggestion: Formalisation of Whiting’s mode-stability theorem for Kerr. This result is central to black-hole perturbation theory because it proves the stability of sub-extremal rotating black holes. [B. F. Whiting](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.528308), “Mode Stability of the Kerr Black Hole,”.

**Lauritz van Luijk**: If two pure states on a finite-dimensional bipartite system AB purify the same state on A, they are connected by a unitary in B. This fundamental property, called uniqueness of purifications, is not automatic in bipartite systems of commuting von Neumann algebras. It was recently shown that it is equivalent to a much studied property called Haag duality, which asserts that every operator commuting with all operators in A must belong to B. Haag duality appears in countless mathematical physics papers as a technical mathematical assumption. This result, however, shows that it is not a mere technical assumption, it carries concrete quantum information-theoretic meaning. Moreover, the result allows one to disprove Haag duality in concrete physical setups. For instance, [van Luijk, Stottmeister & Wilming](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/d7nm-gx37) does this for a class of bipartitions in anyonic systems in 2D.

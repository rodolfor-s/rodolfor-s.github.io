## Course Overview

***Description***

We introduce formal theorem proving with the Lean 4 programming language, placing emphasis on developing Quantum Information Theory theorems and proofs. Formal proof writing is an increasingly important skill as Quantum Information grows more sophisticated, and as machine-verification tools gain popularity.

Participants will learn core theorem-proving syntax, the basics of Lean’s own type theory, the notion and use of tactics, and will gain familiarity with the Mathlib and Physlib/QuantumInfo libraries.

***List of main topics:***
- Formal theorem proving in Lean 4
- Machine-verified mathematics for quantum information theory
- Core theorem-proving syntax
- Lean type theory and tactics
- Mathlib and Physlib/QuantumInfo libraries

***Goals***

Learn the ability
- to set up a Lean repository from scratch,
- to assess the quality of AI-written Lean code,
- to reason about mathematics using code,
- to understand the role of logical verification and its significance in today's mathematics research landscape.

### Lecture plans

The following topics are tentative. I may adapt them based on our progress and interests from the audience.

#### 1st Week
- [x] **Lecture 1, 15 Sep:** Motivation, formal verification and proofs, Lean and its foundations
    - What is formal verification and why does it matter for mathematics or physics
    - Autoformalization, and more notes on the role of AI in physics
    - ~~Setting up Lean and VSCode~~
    - first proofs (`#check`, ~~`#eval`, basic tactics~~)
    - *Propositions as types*, and the Curry--Howard correspondence
- [x] **Lecture 2, 17 Sep:** Core proof writing, syntax, and tactics in Lean
    - Using Github and `git`
    - Setting up Lean in VSCode with `elan` and `lake`
    - Expand on 1st lecture's conversation about sets, types, and getting familiar with Lean's syntax
    - Further comments on `#check`, `#eval`, `#print`
    - Introduce main axioms of Lean (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`)
    - ~~Propositional and predicate logic in Lean (`intro`, `apply`, `exact`, `rw`, `simp`)~~
    - ~~Working with natural numbers, integers, and basic algebraic structure~~
    - ~~Introduction to Mathlib: navigating the library, finding lemma~~

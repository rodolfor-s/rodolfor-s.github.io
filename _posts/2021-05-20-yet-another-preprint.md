I'm very happy to announce the release of yet another preprint, this time one that has been on the works since I was a Master's student.  
This is a topic very dear to me (it really makes me curious!), here it is: [Universal terms of the entanglement entropy in a static closed universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06803).  
I have started these studies more or less four years ago at the Federal University of Minas Gerais with my then supervisor, Prof. Nelson Yokomizo, and with the help of our colleague Lucas Menicucci we are now ready to put this work out there.

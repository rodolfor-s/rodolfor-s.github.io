In a new branch of my PhD project, we study the thermodynamics of a reset implementation of algorithmic cooling. This is a device purifying the states of qubits, which initializes them for use in quantum computations. In the point of view employed, the purified state of the qubit is equivalent to a cooled state, in an interesting interplay between quantum thermodynamics and quantum information theory. Check it out: [Thermodynamics of a minimal algorithmic cooling refrigerator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14056)!  
For this study we collaborated with the groups at the University of Stuttgart. In a partnership with the experimental group at the institute, led by Prof. Wrachtrup and Dr. Durga Dasari, we applied our analysis to their NV-center set-up, allowing for a practical comparison of the algorithm with the theoretical bounds for the usual thermodynamic refrigerator, and further making available a set of results that may be used to investigate other experimental platforms.

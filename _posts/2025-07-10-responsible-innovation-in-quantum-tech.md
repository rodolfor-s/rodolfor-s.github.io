I am happy to share my participation in an invited review of the Physics in
Canada journal, alongside my coauthors Bruna S. de Mendon√ßa, Ria Chakraborty,
Katya Driscoll, and Ray Laflamme: . This, however, comes at very sad times, given
the [news of Ray's passing on the 19th of
June](https://obituaries.therecord.com/obituary/raymond-laflamme-1092952717).

Ray was a titan of scientific research, having shaped the landscape of quantum
computing and information in Canada and the world. It is then incredibly
inspiring to have been part of his group, and to have participated in this work
concerning the push for responsible and ethical innovation in the field of
quantum emergent technologies.

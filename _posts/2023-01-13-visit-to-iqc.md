I am on a one-month research visit in Canada, at the IQC in Waterloo, from the 15th of January. I will take up research in the group of Prof. Raymond Laflamme.  
This visit is my first time in North America, and I look forward to the time spent there and the people I will meet. I am expecting some enjoyable and productive times!

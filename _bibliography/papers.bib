  abstract = {Abstract             Although classical thermal machines power industries and modern living, quantum thermal engines have yet to prove their utility. Here, we demonstrate a useful quantum absorption refrigerator formed from superconducting circuits. We use it to cool a transmon qubit to a temperature lower than that achievable with any one available bath, thereby resetting the qubit to an initial state suitable for quantum computing. The process is driven by a thermal gradient and is autonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heat bath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesized quasithermal radiation. If the target qubit is initially fully excited, its effective temperature reaches a steady-state level of approximately 22\,mK, lower than what can be achieved by existing state-of-the-art reset protocols. Our results demonstrate that superconducting circuits with propagating thermal fields can be used to experimentally explore quantum thermodynamics and apply it to quantum information-processing tasks.},

  abstract = {To unify general relativity and quantum theory is hard in part because they are formulated in two very different mathematical languages, differential geometry and functional analysis. A natural candidate for bridging this language gap, at least in the case of the Euclidean signature, is the discipline of spectral geometry. It aims at describing curved manifolds in terms of the spectra of their canonical differential operators. As an immediate benefit, this would offer a clean gauge-independent identification of the metric's degrees of freedom in terms of invariants that should be ready to quantize. However, spectral geometry is itself hard and has been plagued by ambiguities. Here, we regularize and break up spectral geometry into small, finite-dimensional and therefore manageable steps. We constructively demonstrate that this strategy works at least in two dimensions. We can now calculate the shapes of two-dimensional objects from their vibrational spectra. {\copyright} 2013 American Physical Society.}

  abstract = {Neutrino oscillations at the highest energies and longest baselines can be used to study the structure of spacetime and test the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. If the metric of spacetime has a quantum mechanical description, its fluctuations at the Planck scale are expected to introduce non-unitary effects that are inconsistent with the standard unitary time evolution of quantum mechanics. Neutrinos interacting with such fluctuations would lose their quantum coherence, deviating from the expected oscillatory flavour composition at long distances and high energies. Here we use atmospheric neutrinos detected by the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory in the energy range of 0.5--10.0\,TeV to search for coherence loss in neutrino propagation. We find no evidence of anomalous neutrino decoherence and determine limits on neutrino--quantum gravity interactions. The constraint on the effective decoherence strength parameter within an energy-independent decoherence model improves on previous limits by a factor of 30. For decoherence effects scaling as E2, our limits are advanced by more than six orders of magnitude beyond past measurements compared with the state of the art.},

  abstract = {A completely depolarising quantum channel always outputs a fully mixed state and thus cannot transmit any information. In a recent Letter [D. Ebler et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 120502 (2018)], it was however shown that if a quantum state passes through two such channels in a quantum superposition of different orders - a setup known as the "quantum switch" - then information can nevertheless be transmitted through the channels. Here, we show that a similar effect can be obtained when one coherently controls between sending a target system through one of two identical depolarising channels. Whereas it is tempting to attribute this effect in the quantum switch to the indefinite causal order between the channels, causal indefiniteness plays no role in this new scenario. This raises questions about its role in the corresponding effect in the quantum switch. We study this new scenario in detail and we see that, when quantum channels are controlled coherently, information about their specific implementation is accessible in the output state of the joint control-target system. This allows two different implementations of what is usually considered to be the same channel to therefore be differentiated. More generally, we find that to completely describe the action of a coherently controlled quantum channel, one needs to specify not only a description of the channel (e.g., in terms of Kraus operators), but an additional "transformation matrix" depending on its implementation.},

  abstract = {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0{\texttimes}10-21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1{$\sigma$}. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 410-180+160 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z=0.09-0.04+0.03. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 36-4+5M{$\odot$} and 29-4+4M{$\odot$}, and the final black hole mass is 62-4+4M{$\odot$}, with 3.0-0.5+0.5M{$\odot$}c2 radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90\% credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

  abstract = {This white paper discusses and explores the various points of intersection between quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI). It describes how quantum computing could support the development of innovative AI solutions. It also examines use cases of classical AI that can empower research and development in quantum technologies, with a focus on quantum computing and quantum sensing. The purpose of this white paper is to provide a long-term research agenda aimed at addressing foundational questions about how AI and quantum computing interact and benefit one another. It concludes with a set of recommendations and challenges, including how to orchestrate the proposed theoretical work, align quantum AI developments with quantum hardware roadmaps, estimate both classical and quantum resources - especially with the goal of mitigating and optimizing energy consumption - advance this emerging hybrid software engineering discipline, and enhance European industrial competitiveness while considering societal implications.},

  abstract = {The unitary dynamics of quantum systems can be modeled as a trajectory on a Riemannian manifold. This theoretical framework naturally yields a purely geometric interpretation of computational complexity for quantum algorithms, a notion originally developed by Michael Nielsen (Circa, 2007). However, for nonunitary dynamics, it is unclear how one can recover a completely geometric characterization of Nielsen-like geometric complexity. The main obstacle to overcome is that nonunitary dynamics cannot be characterized by Lie groups (which are Riemannian manifolds), as is the case for unitary dynamics. Building on Nielsen's work, we present a definition of geometric complexity for a fairly generic family of quantum channels. These channels are useful for modeling noise in quantum circuits, among other things, and analyze the geometric complexity of these quantum channels.},

  abstract = {Quantum error correction [1, 2, 3, 4] provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, where the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here, we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code, and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of \$\${\textbackslash}varLambda {\textbackslash}mathrm\{=2.14\}{\textbackslash}pm 0.02\$\$when increasing the code distance by two, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143\% {\textpm} 0.003\% error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond break-even, exceeding its best physical qubit's lifetime by a factor of \$\$2.4{\textbackslash}pm 0.3\$\$. Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 {$\mu$}s at distance-5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 {$\mu$}s. We also run repetition codes up to distance-29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events occurring approximately once every hour, or \$\$3\$\$\$\${\textbackslash}times \$\$\$\$\{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{9\}\$\$cycles. Our results present device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.},

  abstract = {This article provides a self-contained pedagogical introduction to the relativistic kinetic theory of a dilute gas propagating on a curved spacetime manifold (M,g) of arbitrary dimension. Special emphasis is made on geometric aspects of the theory in order to achieve a formulation which is manifestly covariant on the relativistic phase space. Whereas most previous work has focussed on the tangent bundle formulation, here we work on the cotangent bundle associated with (M,g) which is more naturally adapted to the Hamiltonian framework of the theory. In the first part of this work we discuss the relevant geometric structures of the cotangent bundle T*M, starting with the natural symplectic form on T*M, the one-particle Hamiltonian and the Liouville vector field, defined as the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field. Next, we discuss the Sasaki metric on T*M and its most important properties, including the role it plays for the physical interpretation of the one-particle distribution function. In the second part of this work we describe the general relativistic theory of a collisionless gas, starting with the derivation of the collisionless Boltzmann equation for a neutral simple gas. Subsequently, the description is generalized to a charged gas consisting of several species of particles and the general relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell equations are derived for this system. The last part of this work is devoted to a transparent derivation of the collision term, leading to the general relativistic Boltzmann equation on (M,g). The meaning of global and local equilibrium and the stringent restrictions for the existence of the former on a curved spacetime are discussed. We close this article with an application of our formalism to the expansion of a homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with a collisional simple gas and its behavior in the early and late epochs.

This is due to vehemently pursued experimental realisations and a magnificently elegant mathematical framework. In this paper, we provide a brief, and hopefully didactic, exposition of Gaussian state quantum information and its contemporary uses, including sometimes omitted crucial details. After introducing the subject material and outlining the essential toolbox of continuous variable systems, we define the basic notions needed to understand Gaussian states and Gaussian operations. In particular, emphasis is placed on the mathematical structure combining notions of algebra and symplectic geometry fundamental to a complete understanding of Gaussian informatics. Furthermore, we discuss the quantification of different forms of correlations (including entanglement and quantum discord) for Gaussian states, paying special attention to recently developed measures. The paper is concluded by succinctly expressing the main Gaussian state limitations and outlining a selection of possible future lines for quantum information processing with continuous variable systems.},

Much attention is devoted to the discussion of separability criteria and entanglement properties of Gaussian states, for their great practical relevance in applications to quantum optics and quantum information, as well as for the very clean framework that they allow for the study of the structure of nonlocal correlations. We give a self-contained introduction to phase-space and symplectic methods in the study of Gaussian states of infinite-dimensional bosonic systems. We review the most important results on the separability and distillability of Gaussian states and discuss the main properties of bipartite entanglement. These include the extremal entanglement, minimal and maximal, of two-mode mixed Gaussian states, the ordering of two-mode Gaussian states according to different measures of entanglement, the unitary (reversible) localization, and the scaling of bipartite entanglement in multimode Gaussian states. We then discuss recent advances in the understanding of entanglement sharing in multimode Gaussian states, including the proof of the monogamy inequality of distributed entanglement for all Gaussian states, and its consequences for the characterization of multipartite entanglement. We finally review recent advances and discuss possible perspectives on the qualification and quantification of entanglement in non Gaussian states, a field of research that is to a large extent yet to be explored.}

  abstract = {Quantum information theory is built upon the realisation that quantum resources like coherence and entanglement can be exploited for novel or enhanced ways of transmitting and manipulating information, such as quantum cryptography, teleportation, and quantum computing. We now know that there is potentially much more than entanglement behind the power of quantum information processing. There exist more general forms of non-classical correlations, stemming from fundamental principles such as the necessary disturbance induced by a local measurement, or the persistence of quantum coherence in all possible local bases. These signatures can be identified and are resilient in almost all quantum states, and have been linked to the enhanced performance of certain quantum protocols over classical ones in noisy conditions. Their presence represents, among other things, one of the most essential manifestations of quantumness in cooperative systems, from the subatomic to the macroscopic domain. In this work we give an overview of the current quest for a proper understanding and characterisation of the frontier between classical and quantum correlations in composite states. We focus on various approaches to define and quantify general quantum correlations, based on different yet interlinked physical perspectives, and comment on the operational significance of the ensuing measures for quantum technology tasks such as information encoding, distribution, discrimination and metrology. We then provide a broader outlook of a few applications in which quantumness beyond entanglement looks fit to play a key role.}

  abstract = {Decoherence and einselection have been effective in explaining several features of an emergent classical world from an underlying quantum theory. However, the theory assumes a particular factorization of the global Hilbert space into constituent system and environment subsystems, as well as specially constructed Hamiltonians. In this work, we take a systematic approach to discover, given a fixed Hamiltonian, (potentially) several factorizations (or tensor product structures) of a global Hilbert space that admit a quasi-classical description of subsystems in the sense that certain states (the "pointer states") are robust to entanglement. We show that every Hamiltonian admits a pointer basis in the factorization where the energy eigenvectors are separable. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that allows us to discover a multitude of factorizations that admit pointer states and use it to explore these quasi-classical "realms" for both random and structured Hamiltonians. We also derive several analytical forms that the Hamiltonian may take in such factorizations, each with its unique set of features. Our approach has several implications: it enables us to derive the division into quasi-classical subsystems, demonstrates that decohering subsystems do not necessarily align with our classical notion of locality, and challenges ideas expressed by some authors that the propensity of a system to exhibit classical dynamics relies on minimizing the interaction between subsystems. From a quantum foundations perspective, these results lead to interesting ramifications for relative-state interpretations. From a quantum engineering perspective, these results may be useful in characterizing decoherence free subspaces and other passive error avoidance protocols.},

In this work, we show that this counterintuitive behavior appears in the very measures that define quantum complexity. Using the framework of quantum resource theories, we study the dynamics of coherence, imaginarity, non-Gaussianity, and magic state resources in random circuit models. Our results reveal that coherence and imaginarity display a quantum Mpemba effect when the system is initialized in resourceful product states, while non-Gaussianity and magic do not. Strikingly, all four resources exhibit the so-called Pontus-Mpemba effect: an initial "preheating" stage accelerates relaxation compared to direct "cooling" dynamics. Taken together, our findings show that Mpemba physics extends beyond thermodynamics and asymmetry, emerging broadly in the resource theories that capture aspects of quantum complexity.},

Gapless phases can in certain cases be explained by the presence of discrete 't Hooft anomalies in the continuum theory. We also discuss integrable flag manifold sigma models, which provide a generalization of the theory of integrable models with symmetric target spaces.

In particular, quantum discord in a separable quantum state is expected to be detected with high-statistical significance. Interestingly, due to the singular nature of the measurement process, quantum discord can be measured following its original definition, and the steering ellipsoid can be experimentally reconstructed, both highly-demanding measurements in conventional setups. In contrast to entanglement, the asymmetric nature of quantum discord and steering can provide witnesses of \$CP\$-violating physics beyond the Standard Model.},

This applies, in particular, to the vacuum of a non-interacting scalar theory in Minkowski spacetime. Discussions on entanglement in field theory have focused mainly on subsystems containing infinitely many degrees of freedom -- typically, the field modes that are supported within a compact region of space. In this article, we study entanglement in subsystems made of finitely many field degrees of freedom, in a free scalar theory in \$D+1\$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The focus on finitely many modes of the field is motivated by the finite capabilities of real experiments. We find that entanglement between finite-dimensional subsystems is \{{\textbackslash}em not common at all\}, and that one needs to carefully select the support of modes for entanglement to show up. We also find that entanglement is increasingly sparser in higher dimensions. We conclude that entanglement in Minkowski spacetime is significantly less ubiquitous than normally thought.},

In this work, we explore these notions in the context of quantum reference frame (QRF) covariance, in which this partitioning is subject to a symmetry constraint. We demonstrate that different reference frame perspectives induce different sets of subsystem observable algebras, which leads to a gauge-invariant, frame-dependent notion of subsystems and entanglement. We further demonstrate that subalgebras which commute before imposing the symmetry constraint can translate into non-commuting algebras in a given QRF perspective after symmetry imposition. Such a QRF perspective does not inherit the distinction between subsystems in terms of the corresponding tensor factorizability of the kinematical Hilbert space and observable algebra. Since the condition for this to occur is contingent on the choice of QRF, the notion of subsystem locality is frame-dependent.},

  abstract = {Landauer's principle bridges information theory and thermodynamics by linking the entropy change of a system during a process to the average energy dissipated to its environment. Although typically discussed in the context of erasing a single bit of information, Landauer's principle can be generalized to characterize irreversibility in out-of-equilibrium processes, such as those involving complex quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the relation between the entropy change of a system and the energy dissipated to its environment can be decomposed into changes in quantum mutual information and a difference in the relative entropies of the environment. Here, we experimentally probe Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime using a quantum field simulator of ultracold Bose gases. Employing a dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme, we track the temporal evolution of the quantum field following a global mass quench from a massive to a massless Klein--Gordon model and analyse the thermodynamic and information-theoretic contributions to a generalized entropy production for various system--environment partitions of the composite system. Our results verify the quantum field theoretical calculations, interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our work demonstrates the ability of ultracold atom-based quantum field simulators to experimentally investigate quantum thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {We show that complementary state-specific reconstruction of logical (bulk) operators is equivalent to the existence of a quantum minimal surface prescription for physical (boundary) entropies. This significantly generalizes both sides of an equivalence previously shown by Harlow; in particular, we do not require the entanglement wedge to be the same for all states in the code space. In developing this theorem, we construct an emergent bulk geometry for general quantum codes, defining "areas" associated to arbitrary logical subsystems, and argue that this definition is "functionally unique." We also formalize a definition of bulk reconstruction that we call "state-specific product unitary" reconstruction. This definition captures the quantum error correction (QEC) properties present in holographic codes and has potential independent interest as a very broad generalization of QEC; it includes most traditional versions of QEC as special cases. Our results extend to approximate codes, and even to the "non-isometric codes" that seem to describe the interior of a black hole at late times.},

  abstract = {A straightforward gravitational path integral calculation implies that closed universes are trivial, described by a one dimensional Hilbert space. Two recent papers by Harlow-Usatyuk-Zhao and Abdalla-Antonini-Iliesiu-Levine have sought to ameliorate this issue by defining special rules to incorporate observers into the path integral. However, the proposed rules are different, leading to differing results for the Hilbert space dimension. Moreover, the former work offers a holographic map realized using a non-isometric code construction to complement their path integral result and clarify its physics. In this work, we propose a non-isometric code that implements the second construction, allowing thorough comparison. Our prescription may be thought of as simply removing the portion of the map that acts on the observer, while preserving the rest, creating an effective holographic boundary at the observer-environment interface. This proposal can be directly applied to general holographic maps for both open and closed universes of any dimension.},

In both types, there is a mean-field limit cycle phase where the local U(1)symmetry and the time-translational symmetry (TTS) of the Liouvillian super-operator are spontaneously broken (SSB). This SSB manifests itself through the appearance of an unconditionally and fully squeezed state at the cavity output, connected to the well-known Goldstone mode. By employing the Wigner function formalism hence, properly including the quantum noise, we show that away from the thermodynamic limit and within the quantum regime, fluctuations notably limit the coherence time of the Goldstone mode due to the phase diffusion. Our theoretical predictions suggest that interacting multimode photonic systems are rich, versatile testbeds for investigating the crossovers between the mean-field picture and quantum phase transitions.

We find that the chaotic behavior is strongest close to the critical point. At high temperatures \${\textbackslash}backslashlambda\_L\$ is nonzero over an extended region that includes both the normal and super-radiant phases. At low temperatures \${\textbackslash}backslashlambda\_L\$ is nonzero in (a) close vicinity of the critical point and (b) a region within the super-radiant phase.

We obtain continuous-variable generalizations of all models, some of which are novel. The Baxter model is mapped to a chain of coupled oscillators and the Rabi model to the optomechanical radiation pressure Hamiltonian.

  abstract = {Half a century ago a local and (seemingly) causally consistent implementation of the projection postulate was formulated for local projectors in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) by utilising the basic property that spacelike local observables commute. This was not the end of the story for whether projective, or ideal measurements in QFT respect causality. In particular, the causal consistency of ideal measurements was brought into question by Sorkin 20 years later using a scenario previously overlooked. Sorkin's example, however, involved a non-local operator, and thus the question remained whether ideal measurements of local operators are causally consistent, and hence whether they are physically realisable. Considering both continuum and discrete spacetimes such as causal sets, we focus on the basic local observables of real scalar field theory -- smeared field operators -- and show that the corresponding ideal measurements violate causality, and are thus impossible to realise in practice. We show this using a causality condition derived for a general class of update maps for smeared fields that includes unitary kicks, ideal measurements, and approximations to them such as weak measurements. We discuss the various assumptions that go into our result. Of note is an assumption that Sorkin's scenario can actually be constructed in the given spacetime setup. This assumption can be evaded in certain special cases in the continuum, and in a particularly natural way in Causal Set Theory. In such cases one can then freely use the projection postulate in a causally consistent manner. In light of the generic acausality of ideal measurements, we also present examples of local update maps that offer causality-respecting alternatives to the projection postulate as an operationalist description of measurement in QFT.},

  abstract = {Given the recent breakthroughs in quantum technology development in R\& D labs all over the world, the perspective of high-tech companies has changed. Product development is initiated next to the existing research and technology development activities. Considering the quantum computer as a product requires standardization and integration of all its building blocks and a mature supply chain that can provide high-quality components and can ensure security of supply. The product development approach puts focus on functionality and performance requirements of the product and uses state-of-the-art technology to build the product. Based on the expected requirements of future products it is possible to outline a product development roadmap. It is expected that a fully functional quantum computer will be available within a decade from now, and will be used by the High Performance Computing (HPC) market, where it will replace (part of) the supercomputers that are currently used for complex calculations and data management. In the short term, a partly functional quantum computer will be available and of interest to the R\&D market, which has a need for such a product to expedite their quantum technology developments. In this paper, we present the product development approach and roadmap for quantum computers, based on superconducting circuits as an example. A group of companies in the Dutch quantum ecosystem ( Quantum Delta ) have joined forces and have started the ImpaQT project. The companies of the ImpaQT consortium form a local supply chain for key components of quantum computers. This paper shows that quantum community has reached the next level of maturity and that the quantum computer as a commercial product looks set to become a reality.},

This approach has had much success in describing the dynamics of real-life open quantum systems in the lab. Such dynamics increase the entropy of the state \${\textbackslash}rho\$ and the bath until both systems reach thermal equilibrium, at which point entropy production stops. Our main result is to show that the entropy production at time \$t\$ is bounded by the relative entropy between the original state and the state at time \$2t\$. The bound puts strong constraints on how quickly a state can thermalise, and we prove that the factor of \$2\$ is tight. The proof makes use of a key physically relevant property of these dynamical semigroups -- detailed balance, showing that this property is intimately connected with the field of recovery maps from quantum information theory. We envisage that the connections made here between the two fields will have further applications. We also use this connection to show that a similar relation can be derived when the fixed point is not thermal.},

  abstract = {Heat-Bath Algorithmic Cooling is a set of techniques for producing highly pure quantum systems by utilizing a surrounding heat-bath and unitary interactions. These techniques originally used the thermal environment only to fully thermalize ancillas at the environment temperature. Here we extend HBAC protocols by optimizing over the thermalization strategy. We find, for any \$d\$-dimensional system in an arbitrary initial state, provably optimal cooling protocols with surprisingly simple structure and exponential convergence to the ground state. Compared to the standard ones, these schemes can use fewer or no ancillas and exploit memory effects to enhance cooling. We verify that the optimal protocols are robusts to various deviations from the ideal scenario. For a single target qubit, the optimal protocol can be well approximated with a Jaynes-Cummings interaction between the system and a single thermal bosonic mode for a wide range of environmental temperatures. This admits an experimental implementation close to the setup of a micromaser, with a performance competitive with leading proposals in the literature. The proposed protocol provides an experimental setup that illustrates how non-Markovianity can be harnessed to improve cooling. On the technical side we 1. introduce a new class of states called maximally active states and discuss their thermodynamic significance in terms of optimal unitary control, 2. introduce a new set of thermodynamic processes, called \${\textbackslash}beta\$-permutations, whose access is sufficient to simulate a generic thermalization process, 3. show how to use abstract toolbox developed within the resource theory approach to thermodynamics to perform challenging optimizations, while combining it with open quantum system dynamics tools to approximate optimal solutions within physically realistic setups.},

  abstract = {We study a refrigerator model which consists of two \$n\$-level systems interacting via a pulsed external field. Each system couples to its own thermal bath at temperatures \$T\_h\$ and \$T\_c\$, respectively (\${\textbackslash}theta{\textbackslash}equiv T\_c/T\_h{$<$}1\$). The refrigerator functions in two steps: thermally isolated interaction between the systems driven by the external field and isothermal relaxation back to equilibrium. There is a complementarity between the power of heat transfer from the cold bath and the efficiency: the latter nullifies when the former is maximized and \{{\textbackslash}it vice versa\}. A reasonable compromise is achieved by optimizing the product of the heat-power and efficiency over the Hamiltonian of the two system. The efficiency is then found to be bounded from below by \${\textbackslash}zeta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm CA\}={\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}sqrt\{1-{\textbackslash}theta\}\}-1\$ (an analogue of the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency), besides being bound from above by the Carnot efficiency \${\textbackslash}zeta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm C\} = {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{1-{\textbackslash}theta\}-1\$. The lower bound is reached in the equilibrium limit \${\textbackslash}theta{\textbackslash}to 1\$. The Carnot bound is reached (for a finite power and a finite amount of heat transferred per cycle) for \${\textbackslash}ln n{\textbackslash}gg 1\$. If the above maximization is constrained by assuming homogeneous energy spectra for both systems, the efficiency is bounded from above by \${\textbackslash}zeta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm CA\}\$ and converges to it for \$n{\textbackslash}gg 1\$.},

  abstract = {Reichenbach's principle asserts that if two observed variables are found to be correlated, then there should be a causal explanation of these correlations. Furthermore, if the explanation is in terms of a common cause, then the conditional probability distribution over the variables given the complete common cause should factorize. The principle is generalized by the formalism of causal models, in which the causal relationships among variables constrain the form of their joint probability distribution. In the quantum case, however, the observed correlations in Bell experiments cannot be explained in the manner Reichenbach's principle would seem to demand. Motivated by this, we introduce a quantum counterpart to the principle. We demonstrate that under the assumption that quantum dynamics is fundamentally unitary, if a quantum channel with input A and outputs B and C is compatible with A being a complete common cause of B and C, then it must factorize in a particular way. Finally, we show how to generalize our quantum version of Reichenbach's principle to a formalism for quantum causal models, and provide examples of how the formalism works.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing and quantum sensing represent two distinct frontiers of quantum information science. In this work, we harness quantum computing to solve a fundamental and practically important sensing problem: the detection of weak oscillating fields with unknown strength and frequency. We present a quantum computing enhanced sensing protocol that outperforms all existing approaches. Furthermore, we prove our approach is optimal by establishing the Grover-Heisenberg limit -- a fundamental lower bound on the minimum sensing time. The key idea is to robustly digitize the continuous, analog signal into a discrete operation, which is then integrated into a quantum algorithm. Our metrological gain originates from quantum computation, distinguishing our protocol from conventional sensing approaches. Indeed, we prove that broad classes of protocols based on quantum Fisher information, finite-lifetime quantum memory, or classical signal processing are strictly less powerful. Our protocol is compatible with multiple experimental platforms. We propose and analyze a proof-of-principle experiment using nitrogen-vacancy centers, where meaningful improvements are achievable using current technology. This work establishes quantum computation as a powerful new resource for advancing sensing capabilities.},

  abstract = {Non-local quantum computation (NLQC) is a cheating strategy for position-verification schemes, and has appeared in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Here, we connect NLQC to the wider context of information theoretic cryptography by relating it to a number of other cryptographic primitives. We show one special case of NLQC, known as \$f\$-routing, is equivalent to the quantum analogue of the conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive, where by equivalent we mean that a protocol for one task gives a protocol for the other with only small overhead in resource costs. We further consider another special case of position verification, which we call coherent function evaluation (CFE), and show CFE protocols induce similarly efficient protocols for the private simultaneous message passing (PSM) scenario. By relating position-verification to these cryptographic primitives, a number of results in the cryptography literature give new implications for NLQC, and vice versa. These include the first sub-exponential upper bounds on the worst case cost of \$f\$-routing of \$2{\textasciicircum}\{O({\textbackslash}sqrt\{n{\textbackslash}log n\})\}\$ entanglement, the first example of an efficient \$f\$-routing strategy for a problem believed to be outside \$P/poly\$, linear lower bounds on entanglement for CDS in the quantum setting, linear lower bounds on communication cost of CFE, and efficient protocols for CDS in the quantum setting for functions that can be computed with quantum circuits of low \$T\$ depth.},

However, its fundamental mechanisms remain inadequately understood. In this letter, we investigate the role of classical and quantum correlations in driving anomalous relaxation behaviors within the framework of quantum resource theories. Through an analysis of multi-qubit systems in local thermal equilibrium, we establish that classical correlations alone can give rise to the Mpemba effect, while quantum correlations become relevant under specific energy degeneracy conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-Markovian memory effects and Hilbert space dimensionality play a crucial role in determining the temperature range over which this effect manifests. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the original anomalous cooling behavior observed in water may also arise from classical or quantum correlations, offering new insights into the underlying mechanisms of the phenomena collectively referred to as the Mpemba effect.},

Descriptions of particles propagating and interacting in spacetimes are constructed by observers, but different observers, separated from each other by translations, construct different spacetime projections from the invariant phase space. Nonetheless, all observers agree that interactions are local in the spacetime coordinates constructed by observers local to them. This framework, in which absolute locality is replaced by relative locality, results from deforming momentum space, just as the passage from absolute to relative simultaneity results from deforming the linear addition of velocities. Different aspects of momentum space geometry, such as its curvature, torsion and non-metricity, are reflected in different kinds of deformations of the energy-momentum conservation laws. These are in principle all measurable by appropriate experiments. We also discuss a natural set of physical hypotheses which singles out the cases of momentum space with a metric compatible connection and constant curvature.},

Among these developments, the Jarzynski equality, being a milestone following the landmark work of Clausius and Kelvin, stands out. The Jarzynski equality relates the free energy difference between two equilibrium states and the work done on the system through far from equilibrium processes. While experimental tests of the equality have been performed in classical regime, the verification of the quantum Jarzynski equality has not yet been fully demonstrated due to experimental challenges. Here, we report an experimental test of the quantum Jarzynski equality with a single {\textbackslash}Yb ion trapped in a harmonic potential. We perform projective measurements to obtain phonon distributions of the initial thermal state. Following that we apply the laser induced force on the projected energy eigenstate, and find transition probabilities to final energy eigenstates after the work is done. By varying the speed of applying the force from equilibrium to far-from equilibrium regime, we verified the quantum Jarzynski equality in an isolated system.},

In a quantum description of matter a single motionless massive particle can in principle be in a superposition state of two spatially-separated locations. This superposition state in gravity, or gravitational cat state, would lead to fluctuations in the Newtonian force exerted on a nearby test particle. The central quantity of importance for this inquiry is the energy density correlation. This corresponds to the noise kernel in stochastic gravity theory, evaluated in the weak field nonrelativistic limit. In this limit, quantum fluctuations of the stress energy tensor manifest as the fluctuations of the Newtonian force. We describe the properties of such a G2S system and present two ways of measuring the cat state for the Newtonian force, one by way of a classical probe, the other a quantum harmonic oscillator. Our findings include: (i) mass density fluctuations persist even in single particle systems, and they are of the same order of magnitude as the mean; (ii) a classical probe generically records a non-Markovian fluctuating force; (iii) a quantum probe interacting with the G2S system may undergo Rabi oscillations in a strong coupling regime. This simple prototypical gravitational quantum system could provide a robust testing ground to compare predictions from alternative quantum theories, since the results reported here are based on standard quantum mechanics and classical gravity.},

In this work, we highlight two formalisms which together can provide a useful theoretical platform suitable for further developments: 1) Quantum field measurements using the Quantum Temporal Probabilities (QTP) method; 2) Closed-Time-Path (CTP) formalism for causal time evolutions. QTP incorporates the detector into the quantum description, while emphasising that the records of measurement are macroscopic, and they can be expressed in terms of classical spacetime coordinates. We first present a new, elementary derivation of the QTP formulas for the probabilities of n measurement events. We then demonstrate the relation of QTP with the Closed-Time-Path formalism, by writing an explicit formula that relates the associated generating functionals. We exploit the path integral representation of the CTP formalism, in order to express the measured probabilities in terms of path integrals. After this, we provide some simple applications of the QTP formalism. In particular, we show how Unruh-DeWitt detector models and Glauber's photodetection theory appear as limiting cases . Finally, with quantum correlation being the pivotal notion in relativistic quantum information and measurements, we highlight the role played by the CTP two-particle irreducible effective action which enables one to tap into the resources of non-equilibrium quantum field theory for our stated purpose.},

We construct the most general effective Lagrangian for the Nambu-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken global internal symmetry up to the fourth order in derivatives. Rotational invariance and spatial dimensionality of one, two or three are assumed in order to obtain compact explicit expressions, but our method is completely general and can be applied without modifications to condensed matter systems with a discrete space group as well as to higher-dimensional theories. The general low-energy effective Lagrangian for relativistic systems follows as a special case. We also discuss the effects of explicit symmetry breaking and classify the corresponding terms in the Lagrangian.

By inverting the process-e.g., drawing on astrophysical observations-an understanding of relativistic features can lead to insight into physics on the microscopic scale. Relativistic fluids have been used to model systems as "small" as colliding heavy ions in laboratory experiments, and as large as the Universe itself, with "intermediate" sized objects like neutron stars being considered along the way. The purpose of this review is to discuss the mathematical and theoretical physics underpinnings of the relativistic (multi-) fluid model. We focus on the variational principle approach championed by Brandon Carter and collaborators, in which a crucial element is to distinguish the momenta that are conjugate to the particle number density currents. This approach differs from the "standard" text-book derivation of the equations of motion from the divergence of the stress-energy tensor in that one explicitly obtains the relativistic Euler equation as an "integrability" condition on the relativistic vorticity. We discuss the conservation laws and the equations of motion in detail, and provide a number of (in our opinion) interesting and relevant applications of the general theory. The formalism provides a foundation for complex models, e.g., including electromagnetism, superfluidity and elasticity-all of which are relevant for state of the art neutron-star modelling.},

  abstract = {In quantum many-body systems, complex dynamics delocalize the physical degrees of freedom. This spreading of information throughout the system has been extensively studied in relation to quantum thermalization, scrambling, and chaos. Locality is typically defined with respect to a tensor product structure (TPS) which identifies the local subsystems of the quantum system. In this paper, we investigate a simple geometric measure of operator spreading by quantifying the distance of the space of local operators from itself evolved under a unitary channel. We show that this TPS distance is related to the scrambling properties of the dynamics between the local subsystems and coincides with the entangling power of the dynamics in the case of a symmetric bipartition. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions for the maximization of the TPS distance and show that the class of 2-unitaries provides examples of dynamics that achieve this maximal value. For Hamiltonian evolutions at short times, the characteristic timescale of the TPS distance depends on scrambling rates determined by the strength of interactions between the local subsystems. Beyond this short-time regime, the behavior of the TPS distance is explored through numerical simulations of prototypical models exhibiting distinct ergodic properties, ranging from quantum chaos and integrability to Hilbert space fragmentation and localization.},

  abstract = {In scenarios coined Maxwell's demon, information on microscopic degrees of freedom is used to seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. This has been studied in the classical as well as the quantum domain. In this paper, we study an implementation of Maxwell's demon that can operate in both domains. In particular, we investigate information-to-work conversion over the quantum-to-classical transition. The demon continuously measures the charge state of a double quantum dot and uses this information to guide electrons against a voltage bias by tuning the on-site energies of the dots. Coherent tunneling between the dots allows for the buildup of quantum coherence in the system. Under strong measurements, the coherence is suppressed, and the system is well-described by a classical model. As the measurement strength is further increased, the Zeno effect prohibits interdot tunneling. A Zeno-like effect is also observed for weak measurements, where measurement errors lead to fluctuations in the on-site energies, dephasing the system. We anticipate similar behaviors in other quantum systems under continuous measurement and feedback control, making our results relevant for implementations in quantum technology and quantum control.},

  abstract = {We present the reaction-coordinate polaron-transform (RCPT) framework for generating effective Hamiltonian models to treat nonequilibrium open quantum systems at strong coupling with their surroundings. Our approach, which is based on two exact transformations of the Hamiltonian followed by its controlled truncation, ends with a new Hamiltonian with a weakened coupling to the environment. This new effective Hamiltonian mirrors the initial one, except that its parameters are dressed by the system-bath couplings. The power and elegance of the RCPT approach lie in its generality and in its mathematical simplicity, allowing for analytic work and thus profound understanding of the impact of strong system-bath coupling effects on open quantum system phenomena. Examples interrogated in this work include canonical models for quantum thermalization, charge and energy transport at the nanoscale, performance bounds of quantum thermodynamical machines such as absorption refrigerators and thermoelectric generators, as well as the equilibrium and nonequilibrium behavior of many-body dissipative spin chains.},

This naturally extends the familiar spinor-helicity formalism for massless particles to one where these variables carry an extra SU(2) little group index for massive particles, with the amplitudes for spin S particles transforming as symmetric rank 2S tensors. We systematically characterise all possible three particle amplitudes compatible with Poincare symmetry. Unitarity, in the form of consistent factorization, imposes algebraic conditions that can be used to construct all possible four-particle tree amplitudes. This also gives us a convenient basis in which to expand all possible four-particle amplitudes in terms of what can be called "spinning polynomials". Many general results of quantum field theory follow the analysis of four-particle scattering, ranging from the set of all possible consistent theories for massless particles, to spin-statistics, and the Weinberg-Witten theorem. We also find a transparent understanding for why massive particles of sufficiently high spin can not be "elementary". The Higgs and Super-Higgs mechanisms are naturally discovered as an infrared unification of many disparate helicity amplitudes into a smaller number of massive amplitudes, with a simple understanding for why this can't be extended to Higgsing for gravitons. We illustrate a number of applications of the formalism at one-loop, giving few-line computations of the electron (g-2) as well as the beta function and rational terms in QCD. "Off-shell" observables like correlation functions and form-factors can be thought of as scattering amplitudes with external "probe" particles of general mass and spin, so all these objects--amplitudes, form factors and correlators, can be studied from a common on-shell perspective.}

Postselection can improve the rate of Fisher information (the average information learned about an unknown parameter from an experimental trial) to cost. This improvement, we show, stems from the negativity of a quasiprobability distribution, a quantum extension of a probability distribution. In a classical theory, in which all observables commute, our quasiprobability distribution can be expressed as real and nonnegative. In a quantum-mechanically noncommuting theory, nonclassicality manifests in negative or nonreal quasiprobabilities. The distribution's nonclassically negative values enable postselected experiments to outperform even postselection-free experiments whose input states and final measurements are optimized: Postselected quantum experiments can yield anomalously large information-cost rates. We prove that this advantage is genuinely nonclassical: no classically commuting theory can describe any quantum experiment that delivers an anomalously large Fisher information. Finally, we outline a preparation-and-postselection procedure that can yield an arbitrarily large Fisher information. Our results establish the nonclassicality of a metrological advantage, leveraging our quasiprobability distribution as a mathematical tool.},

The existence of closed timelike curves is hypothetical. Nevertheless, they can be simulated probabilistically by quantum-teleportation circuits. We leverage such simulations to pinpoint a counterintuitive nonclassical advantage achievable with entanglement. Our experiment echoes a common information-processing task: A metrologist must prepare probes to input into an unknown quantum interaction. The goal is to infer as much information per probe as possible. If the input is optimal, the information gained per probe can exceed any value achievable classically. The problem is that, only after the interaction does the metrologist learn which input would have been optimal. The metrologist can attempt to change her input by effectively teleporting the optimal input back in time, via entanglement manipulation. The effective time travel sometimes fails but ensures that, summed over trials, the metrologist's winnings are positive. Our Gedankenexperiment demonstrates that entanglement can generate operational advantages forbidden in classical chronology-respecting theories.},

We contrast these groups and their geometry with the much more familiar Euclidean and unitary geometries. Both the properties of finite group elements and of the Lie algebra are studied, and special attention is paid to the so-called unitary metaplectic representation of \$Sp(2n,{\textbackslash}Re)\$. Global decomposition theorems, interesting subgroups and their generators are described. Turning to \$n\$-mode quantum systems, we define and study their variance matrices in general states, the implications of the Heisenberg uncertainty principles, and develop a U(n)-invariant squeezing criterion. The particular properties of Wigner distributions and Gaussian pure state wavefunctions under \$Sp(2n,{\textbackslash}Re)\$ action are delineated.},

  abstract = {Bosonic statistics give rise to remarkable phenomena, from the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect to Bose-Einstein condensation, with applications spanning fundamental science to quantum technologies. Modeling bosonic systems relies heavily on effective descriptions: typical examples include truncating their infinite-dimensional state space and restricting their dynamics to a simple class of Hamiltonians, such as polynomials of canonical operators, which are used to define quantum computing over bosonic modes. However, many natural bosonic Hamiltonians do not belong to this simple class, and some quantum effects harnessed by bosonic computers inherently require infinite-dimensional spaces, questioning the validity of such effective descriptions of bosonic systems. How can we trust results obtained with such simplifying assumptions to capture real effects? Driven by the increasing importance of bosonic systems for quantum technologies, we solve this outstanding problem by showing that these effective descriptions do in fact capture the relevant physics of bosonic systems. Our technical contribution is twofold: firstly, we prove that any physical, bosonic unitary evolution can be strongly approximated by a finite-dimensional unitary evolution; secondly, we show that any finite-dimensional unitary evolution can be generated exactly by a bosonic Hamiltonian that is a polynomial of canonical operators. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have implications for classical and quantum simulations of bosonic systems, they provide universal methods for engineering bosonic quantum states and Hamiltonians, they show that polynomial Hamiltonians do generate universal gate sets for quantum computing over bosonic modes, and they lead to an infinite-dimensional Solovay--Kitaev theorem.},

  abstract = {The conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive is among the simplest cryptographic settings in which to study the relationship between communication, randomness, and security. CDS involves two parties, Alice and Bob, who do not communicate but who wish to reveal a secret \$z\$ to a referee if and only if a Boolean function \$f\$ has \$f(x,y)=1\$. Alice knows \$x,z\$, Bob knows \$y\$, and the referee knows \$x,y\$. Recently, a quantum analogue of this primitive called CDQS was defined and related to \$f\$-routing, a task studied in the context of quantum position-verification. CDQS has the same inputs, outputs, and communication pattern as CDS but allows the use of shared entanglement and quantum messages. We initiate the systematic study of CDQS, with the aim of better understanding the relationship between privacy and quantum resources in the information theoretic setting. We begin by looking for quantum analogues of results already established in the classical CDS literature. Doing so we establish a number of basic properties of CDQS, including lower bounds on entanglement and communication stated in terms of measures of communication complexity. Because of the close relationship to the \$f\$-routing position-verification scheme, our results have relevance to the security of these schemes.},

  abstract = {Atomic high-precision measurements have become a competitive and essential technique for tests of fundamental physics, the Standard Model, and our theory of gravity. It is therefore self-evident that such measurements call for a consistent relativistic description of atoms that eventually originates from quantum field theories like quantum electrodynamics. Most quantum metrological approaches even postulate effective field-theoretical treatments to describe a precision enhancement through techniques like squeezing. However, a consistent derivation of interacting atomic quantum gases from an elementary quantum field theory that includes both the internal structure as well as the center of mass of atoms, has not yet been addressed. We present such a subspace effective field theory for interacting, spin carrying, and possibly charged ensembles of atoms composed of nucleus and electron that form composite bosons called cobosons, where the interaction with light is included in a multipolar description. Relativistic corrections to the energy of a single coboson, light-matter interaction, and the scattering potential between cobosons arise in a consistent and natural manner. In particular, we obtain a relativistic coupling between the coboson's center-of-mass motion and internal structure encoded by the mass defect. We use these results to derive modified bound-state energies, including the motion of ions, modified scattering potentials, a relativistic extension of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and the mass defect applicable to atomic clocks or quantum clock interferometry.}

  abstract = {A review is given on the foundations and applications of non-Hermitian classical and quantum physics. First, key theorems and central concepts in non-Hermitian linear algebra, including Jordan normal form, biorthogonality, exceptional points, pseudo-Hermiticity and parity-time symmetry, are delineated in a pedagogical and mathematically coherent manner. Building on these, we provide an overview of how diverse classical systems, ranging from photonics, mechanics, electrical circuits, acoustics to active matter, can be used to simulate non-Hermitian wave physics. In particular, we discuss rich and unique phenomena found therein, such as unidirectional invisibility, enhanced sensitivity, topological energy transfer, coherent perfect absorption, single-mode lasing, and robust biological transport. We then explain in detail how non-Hermitian operators emerge as an effective description of open quantum systems on the basis of the Feshbach projection approach and the quantum trajectory approach. We discuss their applications to physical systems relevant to a variety of fields, including atomic, molecular and optical physics, mesoscopic physics, and nuclear physics with emphasis on prominent phenomena/subjects in quantum regimes, such as quantum resonances, superradiance, continuous quantum Zeno effect, quantum critical phenomena, Dirac spectra in quantum chromodynamics, and nonunitary conformal field theories. Finally, we introduce the notion of band topology in complex spectra of non-Hermitian systems and present their classifications by providing the proof, firstly given by this review in a complete manner, as well as a number of instructive examples. Other topics related to non-Hermitian physics, including nonreciprocal transport, speed limits, nonunitary quantum walk, are also reviewed.},

Following his resolution of Maxwell's Second Law paradox using the latter, which turned on physically instantiating the demon (control subsystem), the quantum engine's design mirrors the classically-chaotic Szilard Map that operates a thermodynamic cycle of measurement, thermal-energy extraction, and memory reset. Focusing on the thermodynamic costs to observe and control the particle and comparing these in the quantum and classical limits, we detail the thermodynamic tradeoffs behind Landauer's Principle for information-processing-induced thermodynamic dissipation in the quantum and classical regimes. In particular, and as found with the classical engine, we show that the sum of the thermodynamic costs over a cycle obeys a generalized Landauer Principle, exactly balancing energy extraction from the heat bath. Thus, the quantum engine obeys the Second Law. However, the quantum engine does so via substantially different mechanisms: classically measurement and erasure determine the thermodynamics, while in the quantum implementation the cost of partition insertion is key.},

Therefore, to adequately handle the matter sector, one has to address two issues already at the kinematic level. First, one has to construct the appropriate background-independent operator algebras and Hilbert spaces. Second, to make contact with low-energy physics, one has to relate this 'polymer description' of matter fields to the standard Fock description in Minkowski space. While this task has been completed for gauge fields, important gaps remained in the treatment of scalar fields. The purpose of this letter is to fill these gaps.}

  abstract = {A black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. Each mode of that radiation is thermal. If the total state is nevertheless to be pure, modes must be entangled. Estimating the minimum size of this entanglement has been an important outstanding issue. We develop a new theory of constrained random symplectic transformations, based on that the total state is pure, Gaussian and random, and every mode thermal as in Hawking theory. From this theory we compute the distribution of mode-mode correlations, from which we bound mode-mode entanglement. We find that correlations between thinly populated modes (early-time high-frequency modes and/or late modes of any frequency) are strongly suppressed. Such modes are hence very weakly entangled. Highly populated modes (early-time low-frequency modes) can on the other hand be strongly correlated, but a detailed analysis reveals that they are nevertheless also weakly entangled. Our analysis hence establishes that restoring unitarity after a complete evaporation of a black hole does not require strong quantum entanglement between any pair of Hawking modes. Our analysis further gives exact general expressions for the distribution of mode-mode correlations in random, pure, Gaussian states with given marginals, which may have applications beyond black hole physics.},

  abstract = {Irreversibility, crucial in both thermodynamics and information theory, is naturally studied by comparing the evolution -- the (forward) channel -- with an associated reverse -- the reverse channel. There are two natural ways to define this reverse channel. Using logical inference, the reverse channel is the Bayesian retrodiction (the Petz recovery map in the quantum formalism) of the original one. Alternatively, we know from physics that every irreversible process can be modeled as an open system: one can then define the corresponding closed system by adding a bath ("dilation"), trivially reverse the global reversible process, and finally remove the bath again. We prove that the two recipes are strictly identical, both in the classical and in the quantum formalism, once one accounts for correlations formed between system and the bath. Having established this, we define and study special classes of maps: product-preserving maps (including generalized thermal maps), for which no such system-bath correlations are formed for some states; and tabletop time-reversible maps, when the reverse channel can be implemented with the same devices as the original one. We establish several general results connecting these classes, and a very detailed characterization when both the system and the bath are one qubit. In particular, we show that when reverse channels are well-defined, product-preservation is a sufficient but not necessary condition for tabletop reversibility; and that the preservation of local energy spectra is a necessary and sufficient condition to generalized thermal operations.},

  abstract = {Governments and researchers across the Global South are important stakeholders in quantum computing, a technology that will likely have global opportunities and ramifications. While quantum computing discussions within the Global North often limit their Global South focus to China, India, and Singapore, quantum computing activity is underway in a wide range of countries across the G-77, from Brazil to South Africa. Through desk research and supplementary expert interviews, this report documents quantum computing activity within the G-77; creates a typology of G-77 states engaged with quantum computing; and analyses initial trends and potential impacts of the technology including reliance on commercial cloud computing infrastructure, knowledge transfer, environmental impact, and possible new geopolitical dynamics. It concludes with preliminary recommendations to support more equitable global technology development.}

  abstract = {Algorithmic entropy can be seen as a special case of entropy as studied in statistical mechanics. This viewpoint allows us to apply many techniques developed for use in thermodynamics to the subject of algorithmic information theory. In particular, suppose we fix a universal prefix-free Turing machine and let X be the set of programs that halt for this machine. Then we can regard X as a set of 'microstates', and treat any function on X as an 'observable'. For any collection of observables, we can study the Gibbs ensemble that maximizes entropy subject to constraints on expected values of these observables. We illustrate this by taking the log runtime, length, and output of a program as observables analogous to the energy E, volume V and number of molecules N in a container of gas. The conjugate variables of these observables allow us to define quantities which we call the 'algorithmic temperature' T, 'algorithmic pressure' P and algorithmic potential' mu, since they are analogous to the temperature, pressure and chemical potential. We derive an analogue of the fundamental thermodynamic relation dE = T dS - P d V + mu dN, and use it to study thermodynamic cycles analogous to those for heat engines. We also investigate the values of T, P and mu for which the partition function converges. At some points on the boundary of this domain of convergence, the partition function becomes uncomputable. Indeed, at these points the partition function itself has nontrivial algorithmic entropy.},

To compare classical and quantum versions of this theorem, we take an algebraic approach. In both classical and quantum mechanics, observables are naturally elements of a Jordan algebra, while generators of one-parameter groups of transformations are naturally elements of a Lie algebra. Noether's theorem holds whenever we can map observables to generators in such a way that each observable generates a one-parameter group that preserves itself. In ordinary complex quantum mechanics this mapping is multiplication by \${\textbackslash}backslashsqrt\{-1\}\$. In the more general framework of unital JB-algebras, Alfsen and Shultz call such a mapping a "dynamical correspondence", and show its presence allows us to identify the unital JB-algebra with the self-adjoint part of a complex C*-algebra. However, to prove their result, they impose a second, more obscure, condition on the dynamical correspondence. We show this expresses a relation between quantum and statistical mechanics, closely connected to the principle that "inverse temperature is imaginary time".},

General relativity makes heavy use of the category nCob, whose objects are (n-1)-dimensional manifolds representing "space" and whose morphisms are n-dimensional cobordisms representing "spacetime". Quantum theory makes heavy use of the category Hilb, whose objects are Hilbert spaces used to describe "states", and whose morphisms are bounded linear operators used to describe "processes". Moreover, the categories nCob and Hilb resemble each other far more than either resembles Set, the category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are functions. In particular, both Hilb and nCob but not Set are *-categories with a noncartesian monoidal structure. We show how this accounts for many of the famously puzzling features of quantum theory: the failure of local realism, the impossibility of duplicating quantum information, and so on. We argue that these features only seem puzzling when we try to treat Hilb as analogous to Set rather than nCob, so that quantum theory will make more sense when regarded as part of a theory of spacetime.}

Suppose we start with a system in thermal equilibrium and then suddenly divide the temperature by q. Then the maximum amount of work the system can do as it moves to equilibrium at the new temperature, divided by the change in temperature, equals the system's Renyi entropy in its original state. This result applies to both classical and quantum systems. Mathematically, we can express this result as follows: the Renyi entropy of a system in thermal equilibrium is minus the "1/q-derivative" of its free energy with respect to temperature. This shows that Renyi entropy is a q-deformation of the usual concept of entropy.},

In particular, we investigate robustness of the encoding dynamics and their ability to tolerate initialization errors, thanks to the existence of non-trivial basins of attraction. As a key application, we show that for stabilizer quantum codes on qubits, a finite-time dissipative encoder may always be constructed, by using at most a number of quantum maps determined by the number of stabilizer generators. We find that even in situations where the target code lacks gauge degrees of freedom in its subsystem form, dissipative encoders afford nontrivial robustness against initialization errors, thus overcoming a limitation of purely unitary encoding procedures. Our general results are illustrated in a number of relevant examples, including Kitaev's toric code.},

Here, we study a higher-order generalization of the quantum Bayes' rule by considering a quantum process undergoing a quantum supermap. For a few families of initial beliefs, we show that a similar unification is possible -- the rules to update the belief of quantum channels can be implemented via a "reverse" quantum supermap, which we call the retrodiction supermap, allowing for applications such as error correction in quantum cloud computing. Analytical solutions are provided for those families, while a recipe for arbitrary initial beliefs is yet to be found.},

Moreover, in the limit of complete irreversibility, our novel effective version of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation sets a lower bound to entropy production that depends only on non-dissipative aspects of the dynamics. Such an approach is also valuable when dealing with jump dynamics with a deterministic limit, such as irreversible chemical reactions.},

To go beyond the mere average, we construct an entropy production operator, that generalizes the value of entropy to the non-commutative case. The operator is Hermitian; its average is non-negative, so that the Second Law takes its usual form \${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}Sigma{\textbackslash}rangle{\textbackslash}geq 0\$; it formally satisfies the Jarzynski equality; and recovers the classical expression for classical processes. We also present features whose fully quantum version is not a straightforward translation of the classical one: these may point to the core difference between classical and quantum thermodynamics.},

We demonstrate that time reversal in this field theory takes the form of a gauge-like transformation which leaves the action invariant up to a generated work term.

  abstract = {Interaction blockade occurs when strong interactions in a confined few-body system prevent a particle from occupying an otherwise accessible quantum state. Blockade phenomena reveal the underlying granular nature of quantum systems and allow the detection and manipulation of the constituent particles, whether they are electrons, spins, atoms, or photons. The diverse applications range from single-electron transistors based on electronic Coulomb blockade to quantum logic gates in Rydberg atoms. We have observed a new kind of interaction blockade in transferring ultracold atoms between orbitals in an optical lattice. In this system, atoms on the same lattice site undergo coherent collisions described by a contact interaction whose strength depends strongly on the orbital wavefunctions of the atoms. We induce coherent orbital excitations by modulating the lattice depth and observe a staircase-type excitation behavior as we cross the interaction-split resonances by tuning the modulation frequency. As an application of orbital excitation blockade (OEB), we demonstrate a novel algorithmic route for cooling quantum gases. Our realization of algorithmic cooling utilizes a sequence of reversible OEB-based quantum operations that isolate the entropy in one part of the system, followed by an irreversible step that removes the entropy from the gas. This work opens the door to cooling quantum gases down to ultralow entropies, with implications for developing a microscopic understanding of strongly correlated electron systems that can be simulated in optical lattices. In addition, the close analogy between OEB and dipole blockade in Rydberg atoms provides a roadmap for the implementation of two-qubit gates in a quantum computing architecture with natural scalability.},

The great majority of models investigated by statistical mechanics over almost one century and a half exhibit positive absolute temperature, because their entropy is a nondecreasing function of energy. Since more than half a century ago it has been realized that this may not be the case for some physical systems as incompressible fluids, nuclear magnetic chains, lasers, cold atoms and optical waveguides. We review these examples and discuss their peculiar thermodynamic properties, which have been associated to the presence of thermodynamic regimes, characterized by negative absolute temperatures. As reported in this review, the ambiguity inherent the definition of entropy has recurrently raised a harsh debate about the possibility of considering negative temperature states as genuine thermodynamic equilibrium ones. Here we show that negative absolute temperatures are consistent with equilibrium as well as with non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In particular, thermometry, thermodynamics of cyclic transformations, ensemble equivalence, fluctuation-dissipation relations, response theory and even transport processes can be reformulated to include them, thus dissipating any prejudice about their exceptionality, typically presumed as a manifestation of transient metastable effects.},

  abstract = {Although not as wide, and popular, as that of quantum mechanics, the investigation of fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics constitutes an important research field in the building of modern physics. Besides the interest for itself, both for physicists and philosophers, and the obvious pedagogical motivations, there is a further, compelling reason for a thorough understanding of the subject. The fast development of models and methods at the edge of the established domain of the field requires indeed a deep reflection on the essential aspects of the theory, which are at the basis of its success. These elements should never be disregarded when trying to expand the domain of statistical mechanics to systems with novel, little known features. It is thus important to (re)consider in a careful way the main ingredients involved in the foundations of statistical mechanics. Among those, a primary role is covered by the dynamical aspects (e.g. presence of chaos), the emergence of collective features for large systems, and the use of probability in the building of a consistent statistical description of physical systems. With this goal in mind, in the present review we aim at providing a consistent picture of the state of the art of the subject, both in the classical and in the quantum realm. In particular, we will highlight the similarities of the key technical and conceptual steps with emphasis on the relevance of the many degrees of freedom, to justify the use of statistical ensembles in the two domains.},

  abstract = {We show that the low-temperature phase transition in ErFeO3 that occurs at a critical temperature of {\textasciitilde} 4 K can be described as a magnonic version of the superradiant phase transition (SRPT). The role of photons in the quantum-optical SRPT is played by Fe magnons, while that of two-level atoms is played by Er spins. Our spin model, which is reduced to an extended Dicke model, takes into account the short-range, direct exchange interactions between Er spins in addition to the long-range Er-Er interactions mediated by Fe magnons. By using realistic parameters determined by recent terahertz magnetospectroscopy and magnetization experiments, we demonstrate that it is the cooperative, ultrastrong coupling between Er spins and Fe magnons that causes the phase transition. This work thus proves ErFeO3 to be a unique system that exhibits a SRPT in thermal equilibrium, in contrast to previous observations of laser-driven non-equilibrium SRPTs.},

Therefore, as a complement to the well-known criteria, we propose several concepts of elementary dynamical maps. Maps of this type do not increase distinguishability of states which are indistinguishable by von Neumann measurements in a given basis. Those notions and convexity allows us to define general classes of processes without quantum memory in a weak and strong sense.

A defining feature of non-Hermitian systems is exceptional points (EPs), where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. Tropical geometry is an emerging field of mathematics at the interface between algebraic geometry and polyhedral geometry, with diverse applications to science. Here, we introduce and develop a unified tropical geometric framework to characterize different facets of non-Hermitian systems. We illustrate the versatility of our approach using several examples, and demonstrate that it can be used to select from a spectrum of higher-order EPs in gain and loss models, predict the skin effect in the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and extract universal properties in the presence of disorder in the Hatano-Nelson model. Our work puts forth a new framework for studying non-Hermitian physics and unveils a novel connection of tropical geometry to this field.},

We first lay the relevant formal foundation, describing the rigorous derivation of the equation of self-forced motion using matched asymptotic expansions and other ideas. We then review the progress that has been achieved in numerically calculating the self-force and its physical effects in the astrophysical scenario of a compact object inspiralling into a (rotating) massive black hole. We highlight the way in which, nowadays, self-force calculations make a fruitful contact with other approaches to the two-body problem and help inform an accurate universal model of binary black hole inspirals, valid across all mass ratios. We conclude with a summary of the state of the art, open problems and prospects. Our review is aimed at non-specialist readers and is for the most part self-contained and non-technical; only elementary-level acquaintance with General Relativity is assumed. Where useful, we draw on analogies with familiar concepts from Newtonian gravity or classical electrodynamics.},

  abstract = {The Unruh effect is the phenomenon that accelerated observers detect particles even when inertial observers experience the vacuum state. In particular, uniformly accelerated observers are predicted to measure thermal radiation that is proportional to the acceleration. Here we consider the Unruh effect for a detector that follows a quantum superposition of different accelerated trajectories in Minkowski spacetime. More precisely, we analyse the excitations of a pointlike multilevel particle detector coupled to a massless real scalar field and moving in the superposition of accelerated trajectories. We find that the state of the detector excitations is, in general, not a mere (convex) mixture of the thermal spectrum characteristics of the Unruh effect for each trajectory with well-defined acceleration separately. Rather, for certain trajectories and excitation levels, and upon the measurement of the trajectory state, the state of the detector excitations features in addition off-diagonal terms. The off-diagonal terms of these "superpositions of thermal states" are related to the distinguishability of the different possible states in which the field is left after its interaction with detector's internal degrees of the freedom.}

An appropriate interpretation is important in order to elucidate what sort of effects a detector might experience depending on its trajectory and the state of the quantum field. Under simplifying assumptions we introduce an analytic formula that separates these two effects.

  abstract = {We analyze the computational power of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics, i.e., conditional time evolutions that arise when a quantum system is monitored and one postselects on a particular measurement record. We establish an approximate equivalence between post-selection and arbitrary non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Namely, first we establish hardness in the following sense: Let \$U=e{\textasciicircum}\{-iHt\}\$ be an NH gate on \$n\$ qubits whose smallest and largest singular values differ by at least \$2{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}text\{poly\}(n)\}\$. Together with any universal set of unitary gates, the ability to apply such a gate lets one efficiently emulate postselection. The resulting model decides every language in PostBQP; hence, under standard complexity conjectures, fully scalable NH quantum computers are unlikely to be engineered. Second, we establish upper bounds which show that conversely, any non-Hermitian evolution can be written as a unitary on a system-meter pair followed by postselecting the meter. This ``purification'' is compact -- it introduces only \$O({\textbackslash}delta{\textasciicircum}\{2\})\$ Trotter error per time step \${\textbackslash}delta\$ -- so any NH model whose purification lies in a strongly simulable unitary family (e.g., Clifford, matchgate, or low-bond-dimension tensor-network circuits) remains efficiently simulable. Thus, non-Hermitian physics neither guarantees a quantum advantage nor precludes efficient classical simulation: its complexity is controlled by the singular-value radius of the evolution operator and by the structure of its unitary purification.},

The problem of correlating distant reference frames, of which aligning Cartesian axes and synchronizing clocks are important instances, is an example of a task that requires the exchange of unspeakable information and for which it is interesting to determine the fundamental quantum limit of efficiency. There have also been many investigations into the information theory that is appropriate for parties that lack reference frames or that lack correlation between their reference frames, restrictions that result in global and local superselection rules. In the presence of these, quantum unspeakable information becomes a new kind of resource that can be manipulated, depleted, quantified, etcetera. Methods have also been developed to contend with these restrictions using relational encodings, particularly in the context of computation, cryptography, communication, and the manipulation of entanglement.

The qubits are kept in a thermal state with a temperature that is controlled in an interplay between work done on the qubits by changing their energy splittings and the flow of heat between the qubits and the environment. Using only a few qubits, it is possible to control the thermal environment of another quantum system, which can be heated or cooled by the qubits. As an example, we show how a quantum system at subkelvin temperatures can be significantly and accurately cooled on a nanosecond timescale. Our proposal can potentially be realized with superconducting flux qubits, charge qubits, or spin qubits, which can now be fabricated and manipulated with exquisite control.},

  abstract = {Mechanical systems facilitate the development of a new generation of hybrid quantum technology comprising electrical, optical, atomic and acoustic degrees of freedom. Entanglement is the essential resource that defines this new paradigm of quantum enabled devices. Continuous variable (CV) entangled fields, known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states, are spatially separated two-mode squeezed states that can be used to implement quantum teleportation and quantum communication. In the optical domain, EPR states are typically generated using nondegenerate optical amplifiers and at microwave frequencies Josephson circuits can serve as a nonlinear medium. It is an outstanding goal to deterministically generate and distribute entangled states with a mechanical oscillator. Here we observe stationary emission of path-entangled microwave radiation from a parametrically driven 30 micrometer long silicon nanostring oscillator, squeezing the joint field operators of two thermal modes by 3.40(37) dB below the vacuum level. This mechanical system correlates up to 50 photons/s/Hz giving rise to a quantum discord that is robust with respect to microwave noise. Such generalized quantum correlations of separable states are important for quantum enhanced detection and provide direct evidence for the non-classical nature of the mechanical oscillator without directly measuring its state. This noninvasive measurement scheme allows to infer information about otherwise inaccessible objects with potential implications in sensing, open system dynamics and fundamental tests of quantum gravity. In the near future, similar on-chip devices can be used to entangle subsystems on vastly different energy scales such as microwave and optical photons.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of dynamic cooling whereby a target qubit is cooled at the expense of heating up {$N-$}1 further identical qubits by means of a global unitary operation. A standard back-of-the-envelope high-temperature estimate establishes that the target qubit temperature can be dynamically cooled by at most a factor of 1/{\textsurd}{$N$}. Here we provide the exact expression for the minimum temperature to which the target qubit can be cooled and reveal that there is a crossover from the high initial temperature regime, where the scaling is 1/{\textsurd}{$N$}, to a low initial temperature regime, where a much faster scaling of 1/{$N$} occurs. This slow, 1/{\textsurd}{$N$} scaling, which was relevant for early high-temperature NMR quantum computers, is the reason dynamic cooling was dismissed as ineffectual around 20 years ago; the fact that current low-temperature quantum computers fall in the fast, 1/{$N$} scaling regime, reinstates the appeal of dynamic cooling today. We further show that the associated work cost of cooling is exponentially more advantageous in the low-temperature regime. We discuss the implementation of dynamic cooling in terms of quantum circuits and examine the effects of hardware noise. We successfully demonstrate dynamic cooling in a three-qubit system on a real quantum processor. Since the circuit size grows quickly with {$N$}, scaling dynamic cooling to larger systems on noisy devices poses a challenge. We therefore propose a suboptimal cooling algorithm, whereby relinquishing a small amount of cooling capability results in a drastically reduced circuit complexity, greatly facilitating the implementation of dynamic cooling on near-future quantum computers.},

They have initiated, and continue to carry out, a vigorous program in theory, algorithm, and hardware co-design for simulations of relevance to the HEP mission.

  abstract = {A proof is one of the most important concepts of mathematics. However, there is a striking difference between how a proof is defined in theory and how it is used in practice. This puts the unique status of mathematics as exact science into peril. Now may be the time to reconcile theory and practice, i.e. precision and intuition, through the advent of computer proof assistants. For the most time this has been a topic for experts in specialized communities. However, mathematical proofs have become increasingly sophisticated, stretching the boundaries of what is humanly comprehensible, so that leading mathematicians have asked for formal verification of their proofs. At the same time, major theorems in mathematics have recently been computer-verified by people from outside of these communities, even by beginning students. This article investigates the gap between the different definitions of a proof and possibilities to build bridges. It is written as a polemic or a collage by different members of the communities in mathematics and computer science at different stages of their careers, challenging well-known preconceptions and exploring new perspectives.},

  abstract = {This paper explores multiple closely related themes: bounding the complexity of Diophantine equations over the integers and developing mathematical proofs in parallel with formal theorem provers. Hilbert's Tenth Problem (H10) asks about the decidability of Diophantine equations and has been answered negatively by Davis, Putnam, Robinson and Matiyasevich. It is natural to ask for which subclasses of Diophantine equations H10 remains undecidable. Such subclasses can be defined in terms of universal pairs: bounds on the number of variables \${\textbackslash}nu\$ and degree \${\textbackslash}delta\$ such that all Diophantine equations can be rewritten in at most this complexity. Our work develops explicit universal pairs \$({\textbackslash}nu, {\textbackslash}delta)\$ for integer unknowns, achieving new bounds that cannot be obtained by naive translations from known results over \${\textbackslash}mathbb N\$. In parallel, we have conducted a formal verification of our results using the proof assistant Isabelle. While formal proof verification has traditionally been applied a posteriori to known results, this project integrates formalization into the discovery and development process. In a final section, we describe key insights gained from this unusual approach and its implications for mathematical practice. Our work contributes both to the study of Diophantine equations and to the broader question of how mathematics is conducted in the 21st century.},

  abstract = {We present a universal construction of Diophantine equations with bounded complexity in Isabelle/HOL. This is a formalization of our own work in number theory. Hilbert's Tenth Problem was answered negatively by Yuri Matiyasevich, who showed that there is no general algorithm to decide whether an arbitrary Diophantine equation has a solution. However, the problem remains open when generalized to the field of rational numbers, or contrarily, when restricted to Diophantine equations with bounded complexity, characterized by the number of variables \${\textbackslash}nu\$ and the degree \${\textbackslash}delta\$. If every Diophantine set can be represented within the bounds \$({\textbackslash}nu, {\textbackslash}delta)\$, we say that this pair is universal, and it follows that the corresponding class of equations is undecidable. In a separate mathematics article, we have determined the first non-trivial universal pair for the case of integer unknowns. In this paper, we contribute a formal verification of the main construction required to establish said universal pair. In doing so, we markedly extend the Isabelle AFP entry on multivariate polynomials, formalize parts of a number theory textbook, and develop classical theory on Diophantine equations in Isabelle. Additionally, our work includes metaprogramming infrastructure designed to efficiently handle complex definitions of multivariate polynomials. Our mathematical draft has been formalized while the mathematical research was ongoing, and benefitted largely from the help of the theorem prover. We reflect how the close collaboration between mathematician and computer is an uncommon but promising modus operandi.},

We characterize the general structure of causal complete measurement superoperators, and exhibit examples that are causal but not localizable. We construct another class of causal bipartite superoperators that are not localizable by invoking bounds on the strength of correlations among the parts of a quantum system. A bipartite superoperator is said to be semilocalizable if it can be implemented with one-way quantum communication from Alice to Bob, and it is semicausal if it conveys no information from Bob to Alice. We show that all semicausal complete measurement superoperators are semilocalizable, and we establish a general criterion for semicausality.

  abstract = {Perhaps the most important aspect of symmetry in physics is the idea that a state does not need to have the same symmetries as the theory that describes it. This phenomenon is known as spontaneous symmetry breaking. In these lecture notes, starting from a careful definition of symmetry in physics, we introduce symmetry breaking and its consequences. Emphasis is placed on the physics of singular limits, showing the reality of symmetry breaking even in small-sized systems. Topics covered include Nambu-Goldstone modes, quantum corrections, phase transitions, topological defects and gauge fields. We provide many examples from both high energy and condensed matter physics. These notes are suitable for graduate students.},

  abstract = {There are a number of similarities between black-hole physics and thermodynamics. Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples.},

  abstract = {In this study, the mechanisms of hot tearing in B206 aluminum alloy were investigated. Castings were produced at three mold temperatures (250{$^\circ$}C, 325{$^\circ$}C and 400{$^\circ$}C) and with two levels of titanium (0.02wt\% and 0.05wt\%) to investigate the effects of cooling rate and grain refinement. A constrained-rod casting mold attached to a load cell was used to monitor the contraction force during solidification and subsequently determine the onset temperature of hot tearing in B206. The corresponding onset solid fraction of hot tearing was estimated from the solid phase evolution of {$\alpha$}-Al in B206 using in situ neutron diffraction solidification analysis. Hot tears were found to occur at solid fractions ranging from 0.81 to 0.87. Higher mold temperatures significantly reduced hot tearing severity in B206 but did not alter the onset solid fraction. In contrast, additions of titanium to B206 were effective at eliminating hot tears by transforming the grain structure from coarse dendrites to finer and more globular grains. Finally, in situ neutron diffraction solidification analysis also successfully determined the solid phase evolution of intermetallic Al2Cu during solidification, which in turn, provided a better understanding of the role of Al2Cu in the development of hot tears in B206.},

In the electromagnetic case, we show that the quantization of electromagnetic radiation (which causes decoherence of Alice's particle) and vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field (which limits Bob's ability to localize his particle to better than a charge-radius) both are essential for avoiding apparent paradoxes with causality and complementarity. We then analyze the gravitational version of this gedankenexperiment. We correct an error in the analysis of Mari et al. and of Baym and Ozawa, who did not properly account for the conservation of center of mass of an isolated system. We show that the analysis of the gravitational case is in complete parallel with the electromagnetic case provided that gravitational radiation is quantized and that vacuum fluctuations limit the localization of a particle to no better than a Planck length.

Entanglement entropy in our setup is identical with the thermal entropy in the static patch of de Sitter, and we derive a simple relation between the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor trace and the RG flow of entanglement entropy. In particular, renormalization of the bare couplings and logarithmic divergence of the entanglement entropy are interrelated in our setup. We confirm our findings by recovering known universal contributions for a free field theory deformed by a mass operator as well as obtain correct universal behaviour at the fixed points. Simple examples of entanglement entropy flows are elaborated in d=2,3,4. Inthreedimensionswefindthatwhiletherenormalizedentanglemententropy is stationary at the fixed points, it is not monotonic. We provide a computational evidence that the universal `area law' for a conformally coupled scalar is different from the known result in the literature, and argue that this difference survives in the limit of flat space. Finally, we carry out the spectral decomposition of entanglement entropy flow and discuss its application to the F-theorem.},

This analysis also provides insight into the Einstein principle of equivalence between acceleration and gravity. The Unruh temperature can also be obtained by using the Kubo--Martin--Schwinger (KMS) periodicity of the two-point thermal correlation function, for a system undergoing uniform acceleration; as with much of the material in this paper, this known result is obtained with a twist.},

  abstract = {For systems consisting of distinguishable particles, there exists an agreed upon notion of entanglement which is fundamentally based on the possibility of addressing individually each one of the constituent parties. Instead, the indistinguishability of identical particles hinders their individual addressability and has prompted diverse, sometimes discordant definitions of entanglement. In the present review, we provide a comparative analysis of the relevant existing approaches, which is based on the characterization of bipartite entanglement in terms of the behaviour of correlation functions. Such a point of view provides a fairly general setting where to discuss the presence of non-local effects; it is performed in the light of the following general consistency criteria: (i) entanglement corresponds to non-local correlations and cannot be generated by local operations; (ii) when, by ``freezing'' suitable degrees of freedom, identical particles can be effectively distinguished, their entanglement must reduce to the one that holds for distinguishable particles; (iii) in absence of other quantum resources, only entanglement can outperform classical information protocols. These three requests provide a setting that allows to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the existing approaches to indistinguishable particle entanglement and to contribute to the current understanding of such a crucial issue. Indeed, they can be classified into five different classes: four hinging on the notion of particle and one based on that of physical modes. We show that only the latter approach is consistent with all three criteria, each of the others indeed violating at least one of them.},

This behaviour hinges on collective observables, named quantum fluctuations, that retain a quantum character even in the thermodynamic limit: they provide useful tools for studying properties of many-body systems at the mesoscopic level, in between the quantum microscopic scale and the classical macroscopic one. We hereby present the general theory of quantum fluctuations in mesoscopic systems and study their dynamics in a quantum open system setting, taking into account the unavoidable effects of dissipation and noise induced by the external environment. As in the case of microscopic systems, decoherence is not always the only dominating effect at the mesoscopic scale: certain type of environments can provide means for entangling collective fluctuations through a purely noisy mechanism.},

  abstract = {The Hamiltonian H specifies the energy levels and time evolution of a quantum theory. A standard axiom of quantum mechanics requires that H be Hermitian because Hermiticity guarantees that the energy spectrum is real and that time evolution is unitary (probability-preserving). This paper describes an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics in which the mathematical axiom of Hermiticity (transpose + complex conjugate) is replaced by the physically transparent condition of space-time reflection (PT) symmetry. If H has an unbroken PT symmetry, then the spectrum is real. Examples of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are H=p{\textasciicircum}2+ix{\textasciicircum}3 and H=p{\textasciicircum}2-x{\textasciicircum}4. Amazingly, the energy levels of these Hamiltonians are all real and positive! In general, if H has an unbroken PT symmetry, then it has another symmetry represented by a linear operator C. Using C, one can construct a time-independent inner product with a positive-definite norm. Thus, PT-symmetric Hamiltonians describe a new class of complex quantum theories having positive probabilities and unitary time evolution. The Lee Model is an example of a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. The renormalized Lee-model Hamiltonian has a negative-norm "ghost" state because renormalization causes the Hamiltonian to become non-Hermitian. For the past 50 years there have been many attempts to find a physical interpretation for the ghost, but all such attempts failed. Our interpretation of the ghost is simply that the non-Hermitian Lee Model Hamiltonian is PT-symmetric. The C operator for the Lee Model is calculated exactly and in closed form and the ghost is shown to be a physical state having a positive norm. The ideas of PT symmetry are illustrated by using many quantum-mechanical and quantum-field-theoretic models.},

  abstract = {Computers may be thought of as engines for transforming free energy into waste heat and mathematical work. Existing electronic computers dissipate energy vastly in excess of the mean thermal energykT, for purposes such as maintaining volatile storage devices in a bistable condition, synchronizing and standardizing signals, and maximizing switching speed. On the other hand, recent models due to Fredkin and Toffoli show that in principle a computer could compute at finite speed with zero energy dissipation and zero error. In these models, a simple assemblage of simple but idealized mechanical parts (e.g., hard spheres and flat plates) determines a ballistic trajectory isomorphic with the desired computation, a trajectory therefore not foreseen in detail by the builder of the computer. In a classical or semiclassical setting, ballistic models are unrealistic because they require the parts to be assembled with perfect precision and isolated from thermal noise, which would eventually randomize the trajectory and lead to errors. Possibly quantum effects could be exploited to prevent this undesired equipartition of the kinetic energy. Another family of models may be called Brownian computers, because they allow thermal noise to influence the trajectory so strongly that it becomes a random walk through the entire accessible (low-potential-energy) portion of the computer's configuration space. In these computers, a simple assemblage of simple parts determines a low-energy labyrinth isomorphic to the desired computation, through which the system executes its random walk, with a slight drift velocity due to a weak driving force in the direction of forward computation. In return for their greater realism, Brownian models are more dissipative than ballistic ones: the drift velocity is proportional to the driving force, and hence the energy dissipated approaches zero only in the limit of zero speed. In this regard Brownian models resemble the traditional apparatus of thermodynamic thought experiments, where reversibility is also typically only attainable in the limit of zero speed. The enzymatic apparatus of DNA replication, transcription, and translation appear to be nature's closest approach to a Brownian computer, dissipating 20--100kT per step. Both the ballistic and Brownian computers require a change in programming style: computations must be renderedlogically reversible, so that no machine state has more than one logical predecessor. In a ballistic computer, the merging of two trajectories clearly cannot be brought about by purely conservative forces; in a Brownian computer, any extensive amount of merging of computation paths would cause the Brownian computer to spend most of its time bogged down in extraneous predecessors of states on the intended path, unless an extra driving force ofkTln2 were applied (and dissipated) at each merge point. The mathematical means of rendering a computation logically reversible (e.g., creation and annihilation of a history file) will be discussed. The old Maxwell's demon problem is discussed in the light of the relation between logical and thermodynamic reversibility: the essential irreversible step, which prevents the demon from breaking the second law, is not the making of a measurement (which in principle can be done reversibly) but rather the logically irreversible act of erasing the record of one measurement to make room for the next. Converse to the rule that logically irreversible operations on data require an entropy increase elsewhere in the computer is the fact that a tape full of zeros, or one containing some computable pseudorandom sequence such as pi, has fuel value and can be made to do useful thermodynamic work as it randomizes itself. A tape containing an algorithmically random sequence lacks this ability.},

Here we generalize thermodynamics to physical scenarios which allow presence of correlations, including those where strong correlations are present. We exploit the connection between information and physics, and introduce a consistent redefinition of heat dissipation by systematically accounting for the information flow from system to bath in terms of the conditional entropy. As a consequence, the formula for the Helmholtz free energy is accordingly modified. Such a remedy not only fixes the apparent violations of Landauer's erasure principle and the second law due to anomalous heat flows, but also leads to a generally valid reformulation of the laws of thermodynamics. In this information-theoretic approach, correlations between system and environment store work potential. Thus, in this view, the apparent anomalous heat flows are the refrigeration processes driven by such potentials.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing is a fascinating interdisciplinary research field that promises to revolutionize computing by efficiently solving previously intractable problems. Recent years have seen tremendous progress on both the experimental realization of quantum computing devices as well as the development and implementation of quantum algorithms. Yet, realizing computational advantages of quantum computers in practice remains a widely open problem due to numerous fundamental challenges. Interestingly, many of these challenges are connected to performance, robustness, scalability, optimization, or feedback, all of which are central concepts in control theory. This paper provides a tutorial introduction to quantum computing from the perspective of control theory. We introduce the mathematical framework of quantum algorithms ranging from basic elements including quantum bits and quantum gates to more advanced concepts such as variational quantum algorithms and quantum errors. The tutorial only requires basic knowledge of linear algebra and, in particular, no prior exposure to quantum physics. Our main goal is to equip readers with the mathematical basics required to understand and possibly solve (control-related) problems in quantum computing. In particular, beyond the tutorial introduction, we provide a list of research challenges in the field of quantum computing and discuss their connections to control.},

  abstract = {There has been substantial progress in recent years in the quantitative understanding of the nonequilibrium time evolution of quantum fields. Important topical applications, in particular in high energy particle physics and cosmology, involve dynamics of quantum fields far away from the ground state or thermal equilibrium. In these cases, standard approaches based on small deviations from equilibrium, or on a sufficient homogeneity in time underlying kinetic descriptions, are not applicable. A particular challenge is to connect the far-from-equilibrium dynamics at early times with the approach to thermal equilibrium at late times. Understanding the ``link'' between the early- and the late-time behavior of quantum fields is crucial for a wide range of phenomena. For the first time questions such as the explosive particle production at the end of the inflationary universe, including the subsequent process of thermalization, can be addressed in quantum field theory from first principles. The progress in this field is based on efficient functional integral techniques, so-called n-particle irreducible effective actions, for which powerful nonperturbative approximation schemes are available. Here we give an introduction to these techniques and show how they can be applied in practice. Though we focus on particle physics and cosmology applications, we emphasize that these techniques can be equally applied to other nonequilibrium phenomena in complex many body systems.},

  abstract = {Noise is possibly the most formidable challenge for quantum technologies. As such, a great deal of effort is dedicated to developing methods for noise reduction. One remarkable achievement in this direction is dynamical decoupling; it details a clear set of instructions for counteracting the effects of quantum noise. Yet, the domain of its applicability remains limited to devices where exercising fast control is possible. In practical terms, this is highly limiting and there is a growing need for better noise reduction tools. Here we take a significant step in this direction, by identifying the crucial ingredients required for noise suppression and the development of methods that far outperform traditional dynamical decoupling techniques. Using resource theoretic methods, we show that the key resource responsible for the efficacy of dynamical decoupling, and related protocols, is non-Markovianity (or temporal correlations). Using this insight, we then propose two methods to identify optimal pulse sequences for noise reduction. With an explicit example, we show that our methods enable a more optimal exploitation of temporal correlations, and extend the timescales at which noise suppression is viable by at least two orders of magnitude. Importantly, the corresponding tools are built on operational grounds and are easily implemented in the current generation of quantum devices.},

Such devices are also indispensable in the readout chains of superconducting quantum circuits as they protect sensitive quantum systems from the noise emitted by readout electronics. Since ferrite-based nonreciprocal devices are bulky, lossy, and require large magnetic fields, there has been significant interest in magnetic-field-free on-chip alternatives, such as those recently implemented using Josephson junctions. Here we realise reconfigurable nonreciprocal transmission between two microwave modes using purely optomechanical interactions in a superconducting electromechanical circuit. We analyse the transmission as well as the noise properties of this nonreciprocal circuit. The scheme relies on the interference in two mechanical modes that mediate coupling between microwave cavities. Finally, we show how quantum-limited circulators can be realized with the same principle. The technology can be built on-chip without any external magnetic field, and is hence fully compatible with superconducting quantum circuits. All-optomechanically-mediated nonreciprocity demonstrated here can also be extended to implement directional amplifiers, and it forms the basis towards realising topological states of light and sound.},

Recent studies confirm that one-loop N = 8 supergravity amplitudes satisfy the so-called "no-triangle hypothesis", which states that triangle and bubble integrals cancel from these amplitudes. A consequence of this hypothesis is that for any number of external legs, at one loop N = 8 supergravity and N = 4 super-Yang-Mills have identical superficial degrees of ultraviolet behavior in D dimensions. We describe how the unitarity method allows us to promote these one-loop cancellations to higher loops, suggesting that previous power counts were too conservative. We discuss higher-loop evidence suggesting that N = 8 supergravity has the same degree of divergence as N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory and is ultraviolet finite in four dimensions. We comment on calculations needed to reinforce this proposal, which are feasible using the unitarity method. {\copyright} 2006.}

Nevertheless, interference fringes behind the front travel superluminally. For KleinGordon and Dirac wavepackets, the spatially integrated density increases because current is injected at the boundary. Even in the simplest causal model, understanding the shape of the wave after long times is an instructive exercise in the asymptotics of integrals, illustrating several techniques at a level suitable for graduate students; different spatial features involve contributions from a pole and from two saddle points, the uniform asymptotics for the pole close to a saddle, and the coalescence of two saddles into the Sommerfeld precursor immediately behind the front. {\copyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Given this problem's high complexity, it is surprising that a substantial amount of this progress can be ascribed to exact analytical results. Here we review dual-unitary circuits as a particular setting leading to exact results in quantum many-body dynamics. Dual-unitary circuits constitute minimal models in which space and time are treated on an equal footings, yielding exactly solvable yet possibly chaotic evolution. They were the first in which current notions of quantum chaos could be analytically quantified, allow for a full characterisation of the dynamics of thermalisation, scrambling, and entanglement (among others), and can be experimentally realised in current quantum simulators. Dual-unitarity is a specific fruitful implementation of the more general idea of space-time duality in which the roles of space and time are exchanged to access relevant dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements have revealed new links between information geometry and classical stochastic thermodynamics, particularly through the Fisher information (FI) with respect to time. Recognizing the non-uniqueness of the quantum Fisher metric in Hilbert space, we exploit the fact that any quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be decomposed into a metric-independent incoherent part and a metric-dependent coherent contribution. We demonstrate that the incoherent component of any QFI can be directly linked to entropic acceleration, and for GKSL dynamics with local detailed balance, to the rate of change of generalised thermodynamic forces and entropic flow, paralleling the classical results. Furthermore, we tighten a classical uncertainty relation between the geometric uncertainty of a path in state space and the time-averaged rate of information change and demonstrate that it also holds for quantum systems. We generalise a classical geometric bound on the entropy rate for far-from-equilibrium processes by incorporating a non-negative quantum contribution that arises from the geometric action due to coherent dynamics. Finally, we apply an information-geometric analysis to the recently proposed quantum-thermodynamic Mpemba effect, demonstrating this framework's ability to capture thermodynamic phenomena.},

  abstract = {We explore a small quantum refrigerator consisting of three qubits, each of which is kept in contact with an environment. We consider two settings: one is when there is necessarily transient cooling and the other is when both steady-state and transient coolings prevail. Our primary focus, however, is on the transient cooling phenomena. We show that in the transient regime, the temperature of the cold qubit can decrease further compared to the case where all qubits are connected to Markovian environments, by replacing the environment attached to the cold qubit with a finite-size spin environment, modeled by a few quantum spins interacting with the cold qubit. We also consider refrigeration with more than one finite-size spin environments of the three-qubit refrigerating device. As expected, a steady temperature is reached only if there are at least two Markovian baths, regardless of whether the cold qubit is attached to an environment. We investigate the effects of the finite-size environments on the cooling of the cold qubit when one, two, or all Markovian baths are replaced by finite-size environments. Additionally, we examine this effect in two- and single-qubit self-sustained devices connected to one or more finite-size environments. In deriving the dynamical equations for the qubits connected to finite-size environments, we made no assumptions about the Markovian nature of the environment. As a result, these finite-size environments inherently exhibit information backflow from the environment to the system, a hallmark of non-Markovianity. Hence, we propose a witness to detect non-Markovianity in such systems. Finally, the cooling processes are studied in presence of Markovian noise, and we analyse the response on the refrigeration of the noise strength. In particular, we find the noise strength until which refrigeration remains possible.},

In quantum chaotic systems it has been found to behave as in typical pure states, while in integrable systems it has been found to behave as in typical pure Gaussian states. In this tutorial, we provide a pedagogical introduction to known results about the entanglement entropy of subsystems of typical pure states and of typical pure Gaussian states. They both exhibit a leading term that scales with the volume of the subsystem, when smaller than one half of the volume of the system, but the prefactor of the volume law is fundamentally different. It is constant (and maximal) for typical pure states, and it depends on the ratio between the volume of the subsystem and of the entire system for typical pure Gaussian states. Since particle-number conservation plays an important role in many physical Hamiltonians, we discuss its effect on typical pure states and on typical pure Gaussian states. We prove that while the behavior of the leading volume-law terms does not change qualitatively, the nature of the subleading terms can change. In particular, subleading corrections can appear that depend on the square root of the volume of the subsystem. We unveil the origin of those corrections. Finally, we discuss the connection between the entanglement entropy of typical pure states and analytical results obtained in the context of random matrix theory, as well as numerical results obtained for physical Hamiltonians.},

We show that the entanglement entropy SA of a Gaussian state grows linearly for large times in unstable systems, with a rate {$\Lambda$}A {$\leq$} hKS determined by the Lyapunov exponents and the choice of the subsystem A. We apply our results to the analysis of entanglement production in unstable quadratic potentials and due to periodic quantum quenches in many-body quantum systems. Our results are relevant for quantum field theory, for which we present three applications: a scalar field in a symmetry-breaking potential, parametric resonance during post-inflationary reheating and cosmological perturbations during inflation.

We present a method to compute the exact formula of the momenta of the probability \$P(S\_A) {\textbackslash}mathrm\{d\}S\_A\$ that a subsystem has entanglement entropy \$S\_A\$. The method applies to subsystems defined by a subalgebra of observables with a center. In the case of a trivial center, we reobtain the well-known result for the average entropy and the formula for the variance. In the presence of a nontrivial center, the Hilbert space does not have a tensor product structure and the well-known formula does not apply. We present the exact formula for the average entanglement entropy and its variance in the presence of a center. We show that for large systems the variance is small, \${\textbackslash}Delta S\_A/{\textbackslash}langle\{S\_\{A\}\}{\textbackslash}rangle{\textbackslash}ll 1\$, and therefore the average entanglement entropy is typical. We compare exact and numerical results for the probability distribution and comment on the relation to previous results on concentration of measure bounds. We discuss the application to physical systems where a center arises. In particular, for a system of noninteracting spins in a magnetic field and for a free quantum field, we show how the thermal entropy arises as the typical entanglement entropy of energy eigenstates.},

Quantum computers require error correction, which accounts for 99.9\% of the qubit demand and generates heat through information-erasing processes. This heating increases the error rate, necessitating more rounds of error correction. We introduce a dynamical model that characterizes heat generation and dissipation for arrays of qubits weakly coupled to a refrigerator and identify a dynamical phase transition between two operational regimes: a bounded-error phase, where temperature stabilizes and error rates remain below fault-tolerance thresholds, and an unbounded-error phase, where rising temperatures drive error rates beyond sustainable levels, making fault tolerance infeasible. Applying our model to a superconducting qubit system performing Shor's algorithm to factor 2048-bit RSA integers, we find that current experimental parameters place the system in the bounded-error phase. Our results indicate that, while inherent heating can become significant, this thermodynamic constraint should not limit scalable fault tolerance if current hardware capabilities are maintained as systems scale.},

  abstract = {Reducing the thermal noises in microwave (MW) resonators can bring about significant progress in many research fields. Recently, a bench-top cooling method using "quantum refrigerators" has been adopted to reduce the thermal noises, reaching around liquid nitrogen temperature. In this study, we investigate the possible cooling limit of the MW resonator by using three-level or four-level systems as the quantum refrigerator. In this refrigerator system, proper light pump makes the multilevel systems concentrated into their ground states, which continuously absorb the thermal photons in the MW resonator. By adiabatic elimination, we give a more precise description for this cooling process. It turns out, though the multilevel systems can be efficiently cooled down, the laser driving also significantly perturbs their energy levels. For three-level refrigerators, such perturbation causes the atom-resonator interaction to become off-resonant, impeding the heat transfer from the MW resonator to the refrigerator, which greatly weakens the cooling effect. We also find that, by using four-level systems as the refrigerator, this issue can be well overcome. Based on practical parameters, our estimation shows the cooling limit could reach the liquid helium temperature.},

In designing the game, we exploit the correspondence between steerability and the incompatibility of observables. Our work extraction protocol involves mutually unbiased bases, which exhibit maximum incompatibility and therefore maximum steerability, showcased in maximally entangled quantum states. We derive upper bounds on the extractable work for unsteerable and steerable correlations and devise a protocol that saturates the latter. The ratio between the extractable work in steerable and unsteerable scenarios, which encapsulates the quantum advantage, increases with the dimension of the underlying system (sometimes referred to as an unbounded advantage).

  abstract = {The Clifford group plays a central role in quantum information science. It is the building block for many error-correcting schemes and matches the first three moments of the Haar measure over the unitary group -a property that is essential for a broad range of quantum algorithms, with applications in pseudorandomness, learning theory, benchmarking, and entanglement distillation. At the heart of understanding many properties of the Clifford group lies the Clifford commutant: the set of operators that commute with \$k\$-fold tensor powers of Clifford unitaries. Previous understanding of this commutant has been limited to relatively small values of \$k\$, constrained by the number of qubits \$n\$. In this work, we develop a complete theory of the Clifford commutant. Our first result provides an explicit orthogonal basis for the commutant and computes its dimension for arbitrary \$n\$ and \$k\$. We also introduce an alternative and easy-to-manipulate basis formed by isotropic sums of Pauli operators. We show that this basis is generated by products of permutations -which generate the unitary group commutant- and at most three other operators. Additionally, we develop a graphical calculus allowing a diagrammatic manipulation of elements of this basis. These results enable a wealth of applications: among others, we characterize all measurable magic measures and identify optimal strategies for stabilizer property testing, whose success probability also offers an operational interpretation to stabilizer entropies. Finally, we show that these results also generalize to multi-qudit systems with prime local dimension.},

Here, we use the framework put forward by Konopik and Lutz [Phys. Rev. Research \{{\textbackslash}bf 1\}, 033156 (2019)] to go beyond unitary perturbations of the dynamics. Considering an open system comprised of two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, we study the system's response to unitary perturbations, affecting the Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as non-unitary perturbations, affecting the properties of the environment, e.g., its temperature and squeezing. We show that linear response, combined with a quantum probing approach, can effectively provide valuable quantitative information about the perturbation and characteristics of the environment, even in cases of non-unitary dynamics.},

  abstract = {Spin squeezing is a form of entanglement that reshapes the quantum projection noise to improve measurement precision. Here, we provide numerical and analytic evidence for the following conjecture: any Hamiltonian exhibiting finite-temperature easy-plane ferromagnetism can be used to generate scalable spin squeezing, thereby enabling quantum-enhanced sensing. Our conjecture is guided by a connection between the quantum Fisher information of pure states and the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. We demonstrate that spin squeezing exhibits a phase diagram with a sharp transition between scalable squeezing and non-squeezing. This transition coincides with the equilibrium phase boundary for XY order at a finite temperature. In the scalable squeezing phase, we predict a sensitivity scaling that lies between the standard quantum limit and the scaling achieved in all-to-all coupled one-axis twisting models. A corollary of our conjecture is that short-ranged versions of two-axis twisting cannot yield scalable metrological gain. Our results provide insights into the landscape of Hamiltonians that can be used to generate metrologically useful quantum states.},

Quantum theory supports at least two distinct kinds of information (classical and quantum), and a variety of different ways to encode and preserve information in physical systems. A system's ability to carry information is constrained and defined by the noise in its dynamics. This paper introduces an operational framework, using information-preserving structures to classify all the kinds of information that can be perfectly (i.e., with zero error) preserved by quantum dynamics. We prove that every perfectly preserved code has the same structure as a matrix algebra, and that preserved information can always be corrected. We also classify distinct operational criteria for preservation (e.g., "noiseless", "unitarily correctible", etc.) and introduce two new and natural criteria for measurement-stabilized and unconditionally preserved codes. Finally, for several of these operational critera, we present efficient (polynomial in the state-space dimension) algorithms to find all of a channel's information-preserving structures.},

Based on a consideration of the relevant length scales, we derive the universal effective low energy Hamiltonian describing ultracold alkali atoms. We then introduce the concept of the effective action, which generalizes the classical action principle to full quantum status and provides an intuitive and versatile tool for practical calculations. This framework is applied to weakly interacting degenerate bosons and fermions in the spatial continuum. In particular, we discuss the related BEC and BCS quantum condensation mechanisms. We then turn to the BCS-BEC crossover, which interpolates between both phenomena, and which is realized experimentally in the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance. For its description, we introduce the Functional Renormalization Group approach. After a general discussion of the method in the cold atoms context, we present a detailed and pedagogical application to the crossover problem. This not only provides the physical mechanism underlying this phenomenon. More generally, it also reveals how the renormalization group can be used as a tool to capture physics at all scales, from few-body scattering on microscopic scales, through the finite temperature phase diagram governed by many-body length scales, up to critical phenomena dictating long distance physics at the phase transition. The presentation aims to equip students at the beginning PhD level with knowledge on key physical phenomena and flexible tools for their description, and should enable to embark upon practical calculations in this field.}

  abstract = {Physical ageing is the generic term for irreversible processes in glassy materials resulting from molecular rearrangements. One formalism for describing such ageing processes involves the concept of material time, which may be thought of as time measured on a clock whose rate changes as the glass ages. Experimental determination of material time has so far not been realized, however. Here we show how dynamic light-scattering measurements provide a way forward. We determined the material time for an ageing sample of the glass-former 1-phenyl-1-propanol after temperature jumps close to the glass transition from the time-autocorrelation function of the intensity fluctuations probed by multispeckle dynamic light scattering. These fluctuations are shown to be stationary and reversible when regarded as a function of the material time. The glass-forming colloidal synthetic clay Laponite and a chemically ageing curing epoxy are also shown to display material-time-reversible scattered-light intensity fluctuations, and simulations of an ageing binary system monitoring the potential energy confirm material-time reversibility. In addition to demonstrating direct measurements of the material time, our findings identify a fundamental property of ageing in quite different contexts that presents a challenge to the current theories of ageing.},

  abstract = {In the vicinity of ground-state phase transitions quantum correlations can display non-analytic behavior and critical scaling. This signature of emergent collective effects has been widely investigated within a broad range of equilibrium settings. However, under nonequilibrium conditions, as found in open quantum many-body systems, characterizing quantum correlations near phase transitions is challenging. Moreover, the impact of local and collective dissipative processes on quantum correlations is not broadly understood. This is, however, indispensable for the exploitation of quantum effects in technological applications, such as sensing and metrology. Here we consider as a paradigmatic setting the superradiant phase transition of the open quantum Dicke model and characterize quantum and classical correlations across the phase diagram. We develop an approach to quantum fluctuations which allows us to show that local dissipation, which cannot be treated within the commonly employed Holstein-Primakoff approximation, rather unexpectedly leads to an enhancement of collective quantum correlations, and to the emergence of a nonequilibrium superradiant phase in which the bosonic and spin degrees of freedom of the Dicke model are entangled.},

We study the evolution of the background geometry and gauge-invariant scalar perturbations in an inflationary closed FLRW model and calculate the primordial power spectrum. We find that the inflationary dynamics is modified due to the presence of spatial curvature, leading to corrections to the nearly scale invariant power spectrum at the end of inflation. When evolved to the surface of last scattering, the resulting temperature anisotropy spectrum (C TT{$\ell$} ) shows deficit of power at low multipoles ({$\ell$} {\textbackslash}textless 20). By comparing our results with the recent Planck data we discuss the role of spatial curvature in accounting for CMB anomalies and in the estimation of the parameter \${\O}mega\$ k . Since the curvature effects are limited to low multipoles, the Planck estimation of cosmological parameters remains robust under inclusion of positive spatial curvature.},

  abstract = {Canonical discrete quantum error correction (DQEC) schemes use projective von Neumann measurements on stabilizers to discretize the error syndromes into a finite set, and fast unitary gates are applied to recover the corrupted information. Quantum error correction (QEC) based on continuous measurement, known as continuous quantum error correction (CQEC), in principle, can be executed faster than DQEC and can also be resource efficient. However, CQEC requires meticulous filtering of noisy continuous measurement data to reliably extract error syndromes on the basis of which errors could be detected. In this paper, we show that by constructing a measurement-based estimator (MBE) of the logical qubit to be protected, which is driven by the noisy continuous measurement currents of the stabilizers, it is possible to accurately track the errors occurring on the physical qubits in real time. We use this MBE to develop a continuous quantum error correction (MBE-CQEC) scheme that can protect the logical qubit to a high degree, surpassing the performance of DQEC, and also allows QEC to be conducted either immediately or in delayed time with instantaneous feedbacks.},

Geometrically, this recursion computes specific volumes of moduli spaces of metric graphs and is thereby analogous to Mirzakhani's volume recursions on the moduli space of curves. Building on this exact solution, we construct an algorithm that samples points from the moduli space of graphs approximately proportional to their perturbative contribution. Remarkably, this algorithm requires only polynomial time and memory, suggesting that perturbative quantum field theory computations lie in the polynomial-time complexity class, while all known algorithms for evaluating individual Feynman integrals are exponential in time and memory. To demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm, we evaluate the primitive contribution to the \${\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}4\$ beta function at 50 loops with a proof-of-concept implementation.},

One potential application is to probe the interplay between quantum physics and general relativity - a field of physics with no empirical evidence yet. Here we show that quantum networks open a new window to test this interface. We demonstrate how photon mediated entanglement between atomic or atom-like systems can be used to probe time-dilation induced entanglement and interference modulation. Key are non-local measurements between clocks in a gravitational field, which can be achieved either through direct photon interference or by using auxiliary entanglement. The resulting observable depends on the interference between different proper times, and can only be explained if both quantum theory and general relativity are taken into account. The proposed protocol enables clock interferometry on km-scale separations and beyond. Our work thus shows a realistic experimental route for a first test of quantum theory on curved space-time, opening up new scientific opportunities for quantum networks.},

Here we introduce a necessary and sufficient condition for an ideal measurement of an observable to be non-signalling. As well as being particularly simple, it generalises previous no-signalling conditions in that it allows for degeneracies and can be applied to all bounded self-adjoint operators. The condition is used to establish that arbitrary sums of local observables will not signal, in accordance with our expectations from relativistic quantum field theory. On the other hand, it is shown that the measurement of the tensor product of commuting local observables, for example bipartite operators of the form \$A{\textbackslash}otimes B\$, can in fact signal, contrary to the widely-held belief that such measurements are always locally realisable. The implications for the notion of measurement in relativistic quantum field theory are addressed; it appears that the most straightforward application of the standard quantum formalism generically leads to violations of causality. We conclude that either the class of observables that can be measured should be restricted and/or that the na{\textbackslash}"ive translation of the measurement framework of quantum theory, in particular the projection postulate, to quantum field theory should be re-evaluated.},

The different mathematical results are introduced intuitively, before being rigorously stated. This tutorial describes modern aspects of optimal control theory, with a particular focus on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, which is the main tool for determining open-loop control laws without experimental feedback. The different steps to solve an optimal control problem are discussed, before moving on to more advanced topics such as the existence of optimal solutions or the definition of the different types of extremals, namely normal, abnormal, and singular. The tutorial covers various quantum control issues and describes their mathematical formulation suitable for optimal control. The connection between the Pontryagin Maximum Principle and gradient-based optimization algorithms used for high-dimensional quantum systems is described. The optimal solution of different low-dimensional quantum systems is presented in detail, illustrating how the mathematical tools are applied in a practical way.},

  abstract = {A key open problem in physics is the correct way to combine gravity (described by general relativity) with everything else (described by quantum mechanics). This problem suggests that general relativity and possibly also quantum mechanics need fundamental corrections. Most physicists expect that gravity should be quantum in character, but gravity is fundamentally different to the other forces because it alone is described by spacetime geometry. Experiments are needed to test whether gravity, and hence space-time, is quantum or classical. We propose an experiment to test the quantum nature of gravity by checking whether gravity can entangle two micron-sized crystals. A pathway to this is to create macroscopic quantum superpositions of each crystal first using embedded spins and Stern-Gerlach forces. These crystals could be nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. The spins can subsequently be measured to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement. This is based on extensive theoretical feasibility studies and experimental progress in quantum technology. The eventual experiment will require a medium-sized consortium with excellent suppression of decoherence including vibrations and gravitational noise. In this white paper, we review the progress and plans towards realizing this. While implementing these plans, we will further explore the most macroscopic superpositions that are possible, which will test theories that predict a limit to this.},

Naive generalisations of quantum measurement rules can allow for superluminal signalling ('impossible measurements'). This raises the problem of delineating physically allowed quantum measurements and operations. We analyse this issue in a recently proposed framework in which local measurements (in possibly curved spacetime) are described physically by coupling the system to a probe. We show that the state-update rule in this setting is consistent with causality provided that the coupling between the system and probe is local. Thus, by establishing a well-defined framework for successive measurements, we also provide a class of physically allowed operations. Conversely, impossible measurements can only be performed using impossible (non-local) apparatus.},

Quantum computing promises to revolutionise society through technological solutions to previously unsolvable problems or by enhancing the capacities of current computational technologies. Additionally, quantum computing has the potential to revolutionise the humanities and social sciences. We denote the study of these changes as ``quantum humanities'', whose study focuses on the potential of quantum computing. This paper proposes a research programme for quantum humanities, which includes the application of quantum algorithms to humanities research, reflection on the methods and techniques of quantum computing and evaluation of its potential societal implications. Moreover, we argue that, foundationally, quantum mechanics has serious implications for the ways in which data and information are used to produce seemingly objective technologies. Thus, quantum computing is a nexus for the study of knowledge itself. This research programme aims to define the field of quantum humanities and to establish it as a meaningful part of the humanities and social sciences.},

Let L be a hypersurface generated by surface-orthogonal null geodesics with non-positive expansion. Let S be the entropy on L. Then S does not exceed A/4. We present evidence that the bound can be saturated, but not exceeded, in cosmological solutions and in the interior of black holes. For systems with limited self-gravity it reduces to Bekenstein's bound. Because the conjecture is manifestly time reversal invariant, its origin cannot be thermodynamic, but must be statistical. Thus it places a fundamental limit on the number of degrees of freedom in nature.}

The construction of light sheets, which associate relevant spacetime regions to any given surface, is discussed in detail. This article explains how the bound is tested, and its validity is demonstrated in a wide range of examples. A universal relation between geometry and information is thus uncovered. It has yet to be explained. The holographic principle asserts that its origin must lie in the number of fundamental degrees of freedom involved in a unified description of spacetime and matter. It must be manifest in an underlying quantum theory of gravity. This article surveys some successes and challenges in implementing the holographic principle.}

Recently the quantum information contained in Hawking radiation has been calculated, verifying a key aspect of the consistency of black hole evaporation with quantum mechanical unitarity. This calculation relied crucially on recent progress in understanding the emergence of bulk spacetime from a boundary holographic description. Spacetime wormholes have played an important role in understanding the underpinnings of this result, and the precision study of such wormholes, in this and other contexts, has been enabled by the development of low-dimensional models of holography. In this white paper we review these developments and describe some of the deep open questions in this subject.

Endoreversible machines are internally reversible and irreversible losses only occur via thermal contact. We employ quantum control to regulate the direction of heat transfer that occurs via inelastic spin-exchange collisions. We further use full-counting statistics of individual atoms to monitor quantized heat exchange between engine and bath at the level of single quanta, and additionally evaluate average and variance of the power output. We optimize the performance as well as the stability of the quantum heat engine, achieving high efficiency, large power output and small power output fluctuations.}

Such auxiliary bits could be implemented by using spins that rapidly get into thermal equilibrium with the environment, e.g., electron spins. Interestingly, the interaction with the environment, usually a most undesired interaction, is used here to our benefit, allowing a cooling mechanism. Cooling spins to a very low temperature without cooling the environment could lead to a breakthrough in NMR experiments, and our ``spin-refrigerating'' method suggests that this is possible. The scaling of NMR ensemble computers is currently one of the main obstacles to building larger-scale quantum computing devices, and our spin-refrigerating method suggests that this problem can be resolved.},

We find that detectors undergoing linear, catenary, and cusped motions gain fewer correlations in the nonstationary configurations compared to those in stationary configurations. Detectors in circular motion have similar behavior in both configurations. We discuss the relative suppression of correlation harvesting due to high acceleration for each case. Remarkably we find that under certain circumstances detectors in both linear and circular states of motion can harvest genuine (non-communication assisted) entanglement even though they are in causal contact.},

We then determine the error rate function in a very similar fashion to quantum Stein's Lemma, in terms of the quantum relative entropy. Our result has two applications to entanglement theory. First it gives an operational meaning to an entanglement measure known as regularized relative entropy of entanglement. Second, it shows that this measure is faithful, being strictly positive on every entangled state. This implies, in particular, that whenever a multipartite state can be asymptotically converted into another entangled state by local operations and classical communication, the rate of conversion must be non-zero. Therefore, the operational definition of multipartite entanglement is equivalent to its mathematical definition.},

  abstract = {A small quantum absorption refrigerator, consisting of three qubits, is discussed in the transient regime. We discuss time scales for coherent dynamics, damping, and approach to the steady state, and we study cooling and entanglement. We observe that cooling can be enhanced in the transient regime, in the sense that lower temperatures can be achieved compared to the steady-state regime. This is a consequence of coherent dynamics, but can occur even when this dynamics is strongly damped by the dissipative thermal environment, and we note that precise control over couplings or timing is not needed to achieve enhanced cooling. We also show that the amount of entanglement present in the refrigerator can be much larger in the transient regime compared to the steady-state. These results are of relevance to future implementations of quantum thermal machines.},

As an application, we investigate nonrelativistic general covariance in Galilei-invariant systems. The peculiar transformation rules for the background metric and gauge fields, first introduced by Son and Wingate in 2005 and refined in subsequent works, follow naturally from our framework. Our approach makes it clear that Galilei or Poincare symmetry is by no means a necessary prerequisite for making the theory invariant under coordinate diffeomorphisms. General covariance merely expresses the freedom to choose spacetime coordinates at will, whereas the true, physical symmetries of the system can be separately implemented as "internal" symmetries within the vielbein formalism. A systematic way to implement such symmetries is provided by the coset construction. We illustrate this point by applying our formalism to nonrelativistic s-wave superfluids.},

We introduce a broader framework that allows us to derive quantum-mechanical limits on the precision to which a parameter---e.g., elapsed time---may be determined via arbitrary data analysis of arbitrary measurements on \$N\$ identically prepared quantum systems. The limits are expressed as generalized Mandelstam-Tamm uncertainty relations, which involve the operator that generates displacements of the parameter---e.g., the Hamiltonian operator in the case of elapsed time. This approach avoids entirely the problem of associating a Hermitian operator with the parameter. We illustrate the general formalism, first, with nonrelativistic uncertainty relations for spatial displacement and momentum, harmonic-oscillator phase and number of quanta, and time and energy and, second, with Lorentz-invariant uncertainty relations involving the displacement and Lorentz-rotation parameters of the Poincar{\textbackslash}'e group.},

  abstract = {The accumulation of physical errors1--3 prevents the execution of large-scale algorithms in current quantum computers. Quantum error correction4 promises a solution by encoding k logical qubits onto a larger number n of physical qubits, such that the physical errors are suppressed enough to allow running a desired computation with tolerable fidelity. Quantum error correction becomes practically realizable once the physical error rate is below a threshold value that depends on the choice of quantum code, syndrome measurement circuit and decoding algorithm5. We present an end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory on the basis of a family of low-density parity-check codes6. Our approach achieves an error threshold of 0.7\%~for the standard circuit-based noise model, on par with the surface code7--10 that for 20\,years was the leading code in terms of error threshold. The syndrome measurement cycle for a length-n code in our family requires n ancillary qubits and a depth-8 circuit with~CNOT gates, qubit initializations and measurements. The required qubit connectivity is a degree-6 graph composed of two edge-disjoint planar subgraphs. In particular, we show that 12 logical qubits can be preserved for nearly 1~million syndrome cycles using 288 physical qubits in total, assuming the physical error rate of 0.1\%, whereas the surface code would require nearly 3,000~physical qubits to achieve said performance. Our findings bring demonstrations of a low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors.},

We begin with an exact definition of the SW transformation in terms of the so-called direct rotation between linear subspaces. From this we obtain elementary proofs of several important properties of H\_\{eff\} such as the linked cluster theorem. We then study the perturbative version of the SW transformation obtained from a Taylor series representation of the direct rotation. Our perturbative approach provides a systematic diagram technique for computing high-order corrections to H\_\{eff\}. We then specialize the SW method to quantum spin lattices with short-range interactions. We establish unitary equivalence between effective low-energy Hamiltonians obtained using two different versions of the SW method studied in the literature. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the precision up to which the ground state energy of the n-th order effective Hamiltonian approximates the exact ground state energy.},

The latter consists of a certain number of bosonic modes coupled to a constant number of qubits by a Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. We find that efficient approximate weak simulation of an \$n\$-qubit quantum circuit of polynomial size with inverse polynomial error is possible with (1) a linear number of bosonic modes and a polynomial amount of energy, or (2) a sublinear (polynomial) number of modes and a subexponential amount of energy, or (3) a constant number of modes and an exponential amount of energy. Our construction encodes qubits into high-dimensional approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. It provides new insight into the trade-off between system size (i.e., number of modes) and the amount of energy required to perform quantum computation in the continuous-variable setting.},

The fundamentals of density matrix theory, quantum Markov processes, and completely positive dynamical semigroups are developed. The most important master equations used in quantum optics and condensed matter theory are derived and applied to the study of many examples. Special attention is paid to the Markovian and non-Markovian theory of environment induced decoherence, its role in the dynamical description of the measurement process, and to the experimental observation of decohering electromagnetic field states. The book includes the modern formulation of open quantum systems in terms of stochastic processes in Hilbert space. Stochastic wave function methods and Monte Carlo algorithms are designed and applied to important examples from quantum optics and atomic physics. The fundamentals of the treatment of non-Markovian quantum processes in open systems are developed on the basis of various mathematical techniques, such as projection superoperator methods and influence functional techniques. In addition, the book expounds the relativistic theory of quantum measurements and the density matrix theory of relativistic quantum electrodynamics.},

  abstract = {The basic features of the dynamics of open quantum systems, such as the dissipation of energy, the decay of coherences, the relaxation to an equilibrium or non-equilibrium stationary state, and the transport of excitations in complex structures are of central importance in many applications of quantum mechanics. The theoretical description, analysis and control of non-Markovian quantum processes play an important role in this context. While in a Markovian process an open system irretrievably loses information to its surroundings, non-Markovian processes feature a flow of information from the environment back to the open system, which implies the presence of memory effects and represents the key property of non-Markovian quantum behavior. Here, we review recent ideas developing a general mathematical definition for non-Markoviantiy in the quantum regime and a measure for the degree of memory effects in the dynamics of open systems which are based on the exchange of information between system and environment. We further study the dynamical effects induced by the presence of system-environment correlations in the total initial state and design suitable methods to detect such correlations through local measurements on the open system.},

  abstract = {In Newtonian mechanics, inertial pseudoforces - or fictitious forces - appear in systems studied in non-Galilean reference frames; e.g., a centrifugal force seems to arise if the dynamics is analyzed in a rotating reference frame. The equivalent of Galilean invariance for relativistic kinematics is Poincar\${\textbackslash}backslash\$'e invariance; analogous artificial effects may arise in relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) if a system is studied in a framework violating Poincar\${\textbackslash}backslash\$'e invariance. We highlight how such issues complicate the traditional canonical quantization of QFTs and can lead to a subjective description of natural phenomena. In fact, if the system involves the strong interaction, obtaining objective results can become an intractable problem using canonical quantization because the pseudoforces are essentially nonperturbative. In contrast, the treatment of the same problem using light-front (LF) quantization is free of spurious pseudoeffects because Poincar\${\textbackslash}backslash\$'e invariance is manifest; thus the treatment of strong interaction problems becomes simpler. These statements are illustrated using several examples: the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn (GDH) relation, a fundamental feature of QFT; the absence of any measurable impact of Lorentz contraction in high-energy collisions; and the fictitious character of vacuum fluctuation contributions to the cosmological constant.}

In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.},

  abstract = {Analyzing the dynamics of open quantum systems has a long history in mathematics and physics. Depending on the system at hand, basic physical phenomena that one would like to explain are, for example, convergence to equilibrium, the dynamics of quantum coherences (decoherence) and quantum correlations (entanglement), or the emergence of heat and particle fluxes in non-equilibrium situations. From the mathematical physics perspective, one of the main challenges is to derive the irreversible dynamics of the open system, starting from a unitary dynamics of the system and its environment. The repeated interactions systems considered in these notes are models of non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics. They are relevant in quantum optics, and more generally, serve as a relatively well treatable approximation of a more difficult quantum dynamics. In particular, the repeated interaction models allow to determine the large time (stationary) asymptotics of quantum systems out of equilibrium.},

We start with the linearised theory over a classical condensate and construct interacting fields by perturbation theory. Using the concept of thermal masses, equilibrium states at finite temperature can be constructed by the methods developed in arXiv:1306.6519 and arXiv:1502.02705. Here, the principle of perturbative agreement plays a crucial role. The apparent conflict with Goldstone's Theorem is resolved by the fact that the linearised theory breaks the \$U(1)\$ symmetry, hence the theorem applies only to the full series but not to the truncations at finite order which therefore can be free of infrared divergences.}

Virtual qubits are two-level subsystems of this composite, and their virtual temperatures can take on any value, positive or negative. Thermal machines act upon an external system by placing it in thermal contact with a well-selected range of virtual qubits and temperatures. We demonstrate these claims by studying the smallest thermal machines. We show further that this perspective provides a powerful way to view thermodynamics, by analysing a number of phenomena. This includes approaching Carnot efficiency (where we find that all machines do so essentially by becoming equivalent to the smallest thermal machines), entropy production in irreversible machines, and a way to view work in terms of negative temperature and population inversion. Moreover we introduce the idea of "genuine" thermal machines and are led to considering the concept of "strength" of work.},

  abstract = {A wave function exposed to measurements undergoes pure state dynamics, with deterministic unitary and probabilistic measurement induced state updates, defining a quantum trajectory. For many-particle systems, the competition of these different elements of dynamics can give rise to a scenario similar to quantum phase transitions. To access it despite the randomness of single quantum trajectories, we construct an \$n\$-replica Keldysh field theory for the ensemble average of the \$n\$-th moment of the trajectory projector. A key finding is that this field theory decouples into one set of degrees of freedom that heats up indefinitely, while \$n-1\$ others can be cast into the form of pure state evolutions generated by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This decoupling is exact for free theories, and useful for interacting ones. In particular, we study locally measured Dirac fermions in \$(1+1)\$ dimensions, which can be bosonized to a monitored interacting Luttinger liquid at long wavelengths. For this model, the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian corresponds to a quantum Sine-Gordon model with complex coefficients. A renormalization group analysis reveals a gapless critical phase with logarithmic entanglement entropy growth, and a gapped area law phase, separated by a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The physical picture emerging here is a pinning of the trajectory wave function into eigenstates of the measurement operators upon increasing the monitoring rate.},

We show that feedback control is not necessary for operation while entanglement must be present in the measurement projectors. We quantify the probability that QMC occurs when the measurement basis is chosen randomly, and find that it can be very large as compared to the probability of extracting energy (heat engine operation), while remaining always smaller than the most useless operation, namely dumping heat in both baths. These results show that QMC can be very robust to experimental noise. A possible low-temperature solid-state implementation that integrates circuit QED technology with circuit quantum thermodynamics technology is presented.},

These conflicting aspects, at the interface between quantum computing and thermodynamics, are often overlooked or, at best, addressed only at a single-qubit level. In this work, we argue how the existence of a small, but finite, effective temperature, which makes the initial state a mixed state, poses a real challenge to the fidelity constraints required for the scaling of quantum computers.

We formulate the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) particle detector model in terms of the path integral formalism. The formulation is able to recover the results of the model in general globally hyperbolic spacetimes and for arbitrary detector trajectories. Integrating out the detector's degrees of freedom yields a line defect that allows one to express the transition probability in terms of Feynman diagrams. Inspired by the light-matter interaction, we propose a gauge invariant detector model whose associated line defect is related to the derivative of a Wilson line. This is another instance where nonlocal operators in gauge theories can be interpreted as physical probes for quantum fields.}

  abstract = {Recent calculations in both flat and de Sitter spacetimes have highlighted a tension between the decoupling of high-energy physics from low-energy degrees of freedom and the expectation that quantum systems decohere due to interactions with unknown environments. In effective field theory (EFT), integrating out heavy fields should lead to Hamiltonian time evolution, which preserves the purity of low-energy states. This is consistent with the fact that we never observe isolated quantum states spontaneously decohering in the vacuum due to unknown high-energy physics. However, when a heavy scalar of mass \$M\$ is traced out, the resulting purity of a light scalar with mass \$m\$ typically appears to scale as a power of \$1/M\$ (when \$m{\textbackslash}ll M\$), an effect that cannot be captured by a local effective Hamiltonian. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that the purity depends on the resolution scale of the EFT and how the environment is traced out. We provide a practical method for diagnosing the purity of low-energy states consistent with EFT expectations, and briefly discuss some of the implications these observations have for how ultraviolet divergences can appear in decoherence calculations.},

Surprisingly, this turns out not to be the case. And that even if the system in a given inertial frame of reference is separable with respect to the partition momenta versus spins. In detail, we show that if the spin state is initially bound entangled, some boosted observers observe their spin states to be either bound entangled, separable or free entangled.

By studying the coupled dynamics of electromagnetic waves and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole, expressed by the Lorentz force, corresponds to the Abraham momentum and is given by the expectation value of the spin-projected momentum vector. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum is obtained as the magnitude of the spin-projected momentum vector from the energy-momentum dispersion relation derived by diagonalizing the coupled Hamiltonian and determines the direction of refraction in accordance with Snell's law. Our model also predicts a zitterbewegung-like oscillation due to helicity mixing between left- and right-handed wave components, mediated by dipole oscillation. These internal wave dynamics may be observable via wave-packet motion or polarization-sensitive measurements.},

  abstract = {Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) are usually associated with many-body systems with large degrees of freedom approaching the thermodynamic limit. In such systems, the many-body ground state shows abrupt changes at zero temperature when the control parameter of the Hamiltonian is scanned across a quantum critical point. Recently it has been realized that a QPT can also occur in a simple system composed of only a two-level atom and a single-mode bosonic field, described by the quantum Rabi model (QRM). Here we report the first experimental demonstration of a QPT in the QRM using a single trapped ion. We measure the average spin-up state population of the ion and the average phonon number in its spatial oscillation mode as two order parameters and observe the clear evidences of the phase transition via slow quench of the coupling between the ion and its spatial motion. An experimental probe of the phase transitions in a fundamental quantum optics model without imposing the thermodynamic limit opens up a new window for the controlled study of QPTs and quantum critical phenomena.},

While being one of the most promising frameworks for theories beyond the Standard Model, its direct experimental evidence in nature still remains to be discovered. Here we report experimental realization of a supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) model, a reduction of the SUSY quantum field theory for studying its fundamental properties, using a trapped ion quantum simulator. We demonstrate the energy degeneracy caused by SUSY in this model and the spontaneous SUSY breaking. By a partial quantum state tomography of the spin-phonon coupled system, we explicitly measure the supercharge of the degenerate ground states, which are superpositions of the bosonic and the fermionic states.

The rate and the action of the diffusive processes involved in the unraveling are obtained by applying a proper transformation to the operators which define the master equation. The unraveling is first defined for semigroup dynamics and then extended to a definite class of time-dependent generators.

This is defined as the von Neumann entropy SA = -Tr {$\rho$}Alog{$\rho$}A corresponding to the reduced density matrix {$\rho$}A of a subsystem A. For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge c, we re-derive the result of Holzhey et al when A is a finite interval of length in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems, finite temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals. For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length {$\chi$} is large but finite, we show that SA(c/6)log {$\chi$}, where is the number of boundary points of A. These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the case of finite size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models, such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix methods. Finally the free field results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition. {\copyright}2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The problem, however, quickly becomes non-trivial as the size of the multipartition increases. With this motivation in mind, in this paper, we put forth a detailed study of genuine multipartite correlations (GMCs) in the Dicke model of superradiance. We compute all genuine \$k\$-partite correlations for Dicke states with arbitrary excitations and use these results to characterize the evolution of multipartite correlations during the superradiant dynamics. Non-trivial effects in the way correlations in Dicke states are distributed between the multiple parts are found, showing strong finite-size effects. We also employ the concept of weaving to classify how multipartite correlations scale with the number of particles in the system.}

  abstract = {This review is focused on the borderline region of theoretical physics and mathematics. First, we describe numerical methods for the acceleration of the convergence of series. These provide a useful toolbox for theoretical physics which has hitherto not received the attention it actually deserves. The unifying concept for convergence acceleration methods is that in many cases, one can reach much faster convergence than by adding a particular series term by term. In some cases, it is even possible to use a divergent input series, together with a suitable sequence transformation, for the construction of numerical methods that can be applied to the calculation of special functions. This review both aims to provide some practical guidance as well as a groundwork for the study of specialized literature. As a second topic, we review some recent developments in the field of Borel resummation, which is generally recognized as one of the most versatile methods for the summation of factorially divergent (perturbation) series. Here, the focus is on algorithms which make optimal use of all information contained in a finite set of perturbative coefficients. The unifying concept for the various aspects of the Borel method investigated here is given by the singularities of the Borel transform, which introduce ambiguities from a mathematical point of view and lead to different possible physical interpretations. The two most important cases are: (i) the residues at the singularities correspond to the decay width of a resonance, and (ii) the presence of the singularities indicates the existence of nonperturbative contributions which cannot be accounted for on the basis of a Borel resummation and require generalizations toward resurgent expansions. Both of these cases are illustrated by examples.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamics of a quantum system whose interaction with an environment is described by a collision model, i.e. the open dynamics is modelled through sequences of unitary interactions between the system and the individual constituents of the environment, termed "ancillas", which are subsequently traced out. In this setting non-Markovianity is introduced by allowing for additional unitary interactions between the ancillas. For this model, we identify the relevant system-environment correlations that lead to a non-Markovian evolution. Through an equivalent picture of the open dynamics, we introduce the notion of "memory depth" where these correlations are established between the system and a suitably sized memory rendering the overall system+memory evolution Markovian. We extend our analysis to show that while most system-environment correlations are irrelevant for the dynamical characterization of the process, they generally play an important role in the thermodynamic description. Finally, we show that under an energy-preserving system-environment interaction, a non-monotonic time behaviour of the heat flux serves as an indicator of non-Markovian behaviour.},

Due to microreversibility, these obey a fluctuation relation, called the heat engine fluctuation relation, which implies the Carnot bound: no machine can have an efficiency larger than Carnot's efficiency. The stochastic thermodynamics of a quantum heat engine (including the joint statistics of heat and work and the statistics of efficiency) is illustrated by means of an optimal two-qubit heat engine, where each qubit is coupled to a thermal bath and a two-qubit gate determines energy exchanges between the two qubits. We discuss possible solid state implementations with Cooper pair boxes and flux qubits, quantum gate operations, and fast calorimetric on-chip measurements of single stochastic events.},

  abstract = {Engines are systems and devices that convert one form of energy into another, typically into a more useful form that can perform work. In the classical setup, physical, chemical, and biological engines largely involve the conversion of heat into work. This energy conversion is at the core of thermodynamic laws and principles and is codified in textbook material. In the quantum regime, however, the principles of energy conversion become ambiguous, since quantum phenomena come into play. As with classical thermodynamics, fundamental principles can be explored through engines and refrigerators, but, in the quantum case, these devices are miniaturized and their operations involve uniquely quantum effects. Our work provides a broad overview of this active field of quantum engines and refrigerators, reviewing the latest theoretical proposals and experimental realizations. We cover myriad aspects of these devices, starting with the basic concepts of quantum analogs to the classical thermodynamic cycle and continuing with different quantum features of energy conversion that span many branches of quantum mechanics. These features include quantum fluctuations that become dominant in the microscale, non-thermal resources that fuel the engines, and the possibility of scaling up the working medium's size, to account for collective phenomena in many-body heat engines. Furthermore, we review studies of quantum engines operating in the strong system--bath coupling regime and those that include non-Markovian phenomena. Recent advances in thermoelectric devices and quantum information perspectives, including quantum measurement and feedback in quantum engines, are also presented.},

Given a decomposition of Hilbert space H into a tensor product of factors, we consider a class of "redundancy-constrained states" in H that generalize the area-law behavior for entanglement entropy usually found in condensed-matter systems with gapped local Hamiltonians. Using mutual information to define a distance measure on the graph, we employ classical multidimensional scaling to extract the best-fit spatial dimensionality of the emergent geometry. We then show that entanglement perturbations on such emergent geometries naturally give rise to local modifications of spatial curvature which obey a (spatial) analog of Einstein's equation. The Hilbert space corresponding to a region of flat space is finite-dimensional and scales as the volume, though the entropy (and the maximum change thereof) scales like the area of the boundary. A version of the ER=EPR conjecture is recovered, in that perturbations that entangle distant parts of the emergent geometry generate a configuration that may be considered as a highly quantum wormhole.}

A recent approach to this problem is to consider general features of the Hilbert space maps relating these theories. In this work, we construct approximately local observables, or overlapping qubits, from such non-isometric maps. We show that local processes in effective theories can be spoofed with a quantum system with fewer degrees of freedom, with deviations from actual locality identifiable as features of quantum gravity. For a concrete example, we construct two tensor network models of de Sitter space-time, demonstrating how exponential expansion and local physics can be spoofed for a long period before breaking down. Our results highlight the connection between overlapping qubits, Hilbert space dimension verification, degree-of-freedom counting in black holes, holography, and approximate locality in quantum gravity.},

  abstract = {For an open quantum system to evolve under CPTP maps, assumptions are made on the initial correlations between the system and the environment. Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving (HPTP) maps are considered as the local dynamic maps beyond CPTP. In this paper, we provide a succinct answer to the question of what physical maps are in the HPTP realm by two approaches. The first is by taking one step out of the CPTP set, which provides us with Semi-Positivity (SP) TP maps. The second way is by examining the physicality of HPTP maps, which leads to Semi-Nonnegative (SN) TP maps. Physical interpretations and geometrical structures are studied for these maps. The non-CP SPTP maps \${\textbackslash}Psi\$ correspond to the quantum non-Markovian process under the CP-divisibility definition (\${\textbackslash}Psi = {\textbackslash}Xi {\textbackslash}circ {\textbackslash}Phi{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}Xi\$ and \${\textbackslash}Phi\$ are CPTP). When removing the invertibility assumption on \${\textbackslash}Phi\$, we land in the set of SNTP maps. A by-product of set relations is an answer to the following question -- what kind of dynamics the system will go through when the previous dynamic \${\textbackslash}Phi\$ is non-invertible. In this case, the only locally well-defined maps are in \$SN{\textbackslash}backslash SP\$, they live on the boundary of \$SN\$. Otherwise, the non-local information will be irreplaceable in the system's dynamic. With the understanding of physical maps beyond CPTP, we prove that the current quantum error correction scheme is still sufficient to correct quantum non-Markovian errors. In some special cases, lack of complete positivity could provide us with more error correction methods with less overhead.},

Given the ability to impose suitable Hamiltonians upon such a multi-qubit system, one can also implement a set of logical gates which enables universal computation on this information without compromising this protection. Real physical systems, however, seldom come with the correct Hamiltonians built-in, let alone the ability to turn them off and on at will. In the course of our development of quantum information processing devices based on liquid-state NMR, we have found the task of operating on quantum information encoded in decoherence-free subspaces rather more challenging than is commonly assumed. This contribution presents an overview of these challenges and the methods we have developed for overcoming them in practice. These methods promise to be broadly applicable to many of the physical systems proposed for the implementation of quantum information processing devices.},

In this article, we provide a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary overview of the potential impacts of generative AI on (mis)information and three information-intensive domains: work, education, and healthcare. Our goal is to highlight how generative AI could worsen existing inequalities while illuminating how AI may help mitigate pervasive social problems. In the information domain, generative AI can democratize content creation and access but may dramatically expand the production and proliferation of misinformation. In the workplace, it can boost productivity and create new jobs, but the benefits will likely be distributed unevenly. In education, it offers personalized learning, but may widen the digital divide. In healthcare, it might improve diagnostics and accessibility, but could deepen pre-existing inequalities. In each section, we cover a specific topic, evaluate existing research, identify critical gaps, and recommend research directions, including explicit trade-offs that complicate the derivation of a priori hypotheses. We conclude with a section highlighting the role of policymaking to maximize generative AI's potential to reduce inequalities while mitigating its harmful effects. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of existing policy frameworks in the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, observing that each fails to fully confront the socioeconomic challenges we have identified. We propose several concrete policies that could promote shared prosperity through the advancement of generative AI. This article emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaborations to understand and address the complex challenges of generative AI.}

We confirm our procedure for excited states, the thermofield double state, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and discuss its extension to higher-dimensional CFTs. We also show that when applied to reduced density matrices, it reproduces entanglement wedges and holographic entanglement entropy. We suggest that our optimization prescription is analogous to the estimation of computational complexity.},

  abstract = {Quantum reference frames are needed in quantum theory for much the same reasons that reference frames are in classical theories: to manifest invariance in line with fundamental relativity principles and to provide a basis for the definition of observable quantities. Though around since the 1960s, and used in a wide range of applications, only recently has the means for transforming descriptions between different quantum reference frames been tackled in detail. In this work, we provide a general, operationally motivated framework for quantum reference frames and their transformations, holding for locally compact groups. The work is built around the notion of operational equivalence, in which quantum states that cannot be physically distinguished are identified. For example, we describe the collection of relative observables as a subspace of the algebra of invariants on the composite of system and frame, and from here the set of relative states is constructed through the identification of states which cannot be distinguished by relative observables. Through the notion of framed observables -- the formation of joint observables of system and frame -- of which the relative observables can be understood as examples, quantum reference frame transformations are then maps between equivalence classes of relative states which respect the framing. We give an explicit realisation in the setting that the initial frame admits a highly localized state with respect to the frame observable. The transformations are invertible exactly when the final frame also has such a localizability property. The procedure we present is in operational agreement with other recent inequivalent constructions on the domain of common applicability, but extends them in a number of ways, and weakens claims of entanglement generation through frame changes.},

As an example, for weak nuclear decays the momentum of the emitted neutrino can be reconstructed on an event-by-event basis. We present the concept that a single nanometer-scale, optically levitated sensor operated with sensitivity near the standard quantum limit can search for heavy sterile neutrinos in the keV-MeV mass range with sensitivity significantly beyond existing constraints.

  abstract = {We revisit a question asked by Dyson: "Is a graviton detectable?" We demonstrate that in both Dyson's original sense and in a more modern measurement-theoretic sense, it is possible to construct a detector sensitive to single gravitons, and in fact a variety of existing and near-term gravitational wave detectors can achieve this. However, while such a signal would be consistent with the quantization of the gravitational field, we draw on results from quantum optics to show how the same signal could just as well be explained via classical gravitational waves. We outline the kind of measurements that would be needed to demonstrate quantization of gravitational radiation and explain why these are substantially more difficult than simply counting graviton clicks or observing gravitational noise in an interferometer, and likely impossible to perform in practice.},

  abstract = {Ergodicity-breaking and slow relaxation are intriguing aspects of nonequilibrium dynamics both in classical and in quantum settings. These phenomena are typically associated with phase transitions, e.g. the emergence of metastable regimes near a first-order transition or scaling dynamics in the vicinity of critical points. Despite being of fundamental interest the associated divergent time scales are a hindrance when trying to explore steady-state properties. Here we show that the relaxation dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems can be accelerated exponentially by devising an optimal unitary transformation that is applied to the quantum system immediately before the actual dynamics. This initial "rotation" is engineered in such a way that the state of the quantum system becomes orthogonal to the slowest decaying dynamical mode. We illustrate our idea -- which is inspired by the so-called Mpemba effect, i.e., water freezing faster when initially heated up -- by showing how to achieve an exponential speed-up in the convergence to stationarity in Dicke models, and how to avoid metastable regimes in an all-to-all interacting spin system.},

Equilibrium phase transitions fall invariably into two markedly non-overlapping categories: classical phase transitions and quantum phase transitions, whereas in NESS-QPTs this distinction may fade off. The approach described in this review, among other things, can quantitatively assess the quantum character of such critical phenomena. This framework is applied to a paradigmatic class of lattice Fermion systems with local reservoirs, characterised by Gaussian non-equilibrium steady states. The relations between the behaviour of the geometric phase curvature, the divergence of the correlation length, the character of the criticality and the gap - either Hamiltonian or dissipative - are reviewed.},

Such a decomposition can be defined by looking for subsystems that exhibit quasi-classical behavior. The correct decomposition is one in which pointer states of the system are relatively robust against environmental monitoring (their entanglement with the environment does not continually and dramatically increase) and remain localized around approximately-classical trajectories. We present an in-principle algorithm for finding such a decomposition by minimizing a combination of entanglement growth and internal spreading of the system. Both of these properties are related to locality in different ways. This formalism could be relevant to the emergence of spacetime from quantum entanglement.},

  abstract = {In a gauge theory, a collection of kinematical degrees of freedom is used to redundantly describe a smaller amount of gauge-invariant information. In a quantum error correcting code (QECC), a collection of computational degrees of freedom that make up a device's physical layer is used to redundantly encode a smaller amount of logical information. We elaborate this clear parallel in terms of quantum reference frames (QRFs), which are a universal toolkit for quantization in the presence of symmetries. The result is a precise dictionary between QECCs and QRFs within the perspective-neutral framework for constrained systems. Concepts from quantum error correction like error sets and correctability translate to novel insights into the informational architecture of gauge theories. Conversely, the dictionary provides a systematic procedure for constructing symmetry-based QECCs and characterizing their error correcting properties. In this initial work, we scrutinize the dictionary between Pauli stabilizer codes and their corresponding QRF setups, which possess symmetry groups that are isomorphic to the stabilizer group. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal correctable error sets and tensor factorizations splitting system from frame degrees of freedom, relative to which errors corrupt only redundant frame data. When passed through the dictionary, standard Pauli errors from the code essentially behave as electric excitations that are exactly dual, via Pontryagin duality, to magnetic excitations related to gauge-fixing. We comprehensively illustrate our findings in surface codes, which themselves manifestly connect quantum error correction with gauge systems. The exploratory investigations in this article pave the way for deeper foundational applications to quantum gauge theories and for eventual practical applications to quantum simulation.},

  abstract = {Any physical process can be represented as a quantum channel mapping an initial state to a final state. Hence it can be characterized from the point of view of communication theory, i.e., in terms of its ability to transfer information. Quantum information provides a theoretical framework and the proper mathematical tools to accomplish this. In this context the notion of codes and communication capacities have been introduced by generalizing them from the classical Shannon theory of information transmission and error correction. The underlying assumption of this approach is to consider the channel not as acting on a single system, but on sequences of systems, which, when properly initialized allow one to overcome the noisy effects induced by the physical process under consideration. While most of the work produced so far has been focused on the case in which a given channel transformation acts identically and independently on the various elements of the sequence (memoryless configuration in jargon), correlated error models appear to be a more realistic way to approach the problem. A slightly different, yet conceptually related, notion of correlated errors applies to a single quantum system which evolves continuously in time under the influence of an external disturbance which acts on it in a non-Markovian fashion. This leads to the study of memory effects in quantum channels: a fertile ground where interesting novel phenomena emerge at the intersection of quantum information theory and other branches of physics. A survey is taken of the field of quantum channels theory while also embracing these specific and complex settings.},

To evaluate the entropies we extend the standard calculation methods for the entropy of Gaussian states in canonical commutation algebras to the more general case of algebras with center and arbitrary numerical commutators. We find that while the entropy depends on the details of the algebra choice, mutual information has a well defined continuum limit as predicted in [1]. We study several universal terms for the entropy of the Maxwell field and compare with the case of a massless scalar field. We find some interesting new phenomena: an "evanescent" logarithmically divergent term in the entropy with topological coefficient which does not have any correspondence with ultraviolet entanglement in the universal quantities, and a nonstandard way in which strong subadditivity is realized. Based on the results of our calculations we propose a generalization of strong subadditivity for the entropy on some algebras that are not in tensor product.}

In algebraic terms, this is due to the presence of a center - a set of operators which commute with all others - in the gauge invariant operator algebra corresponding to a finite region. A unique entropy can be assigned to algebras with a center, giving a place to a local entropy in lattice gauge theories. However, ambiguities arise on the correspondence between algebras and regions. In particular, it is always possible to choose (in many different ways) local algebras with a trivial center, and hence a genuine entanglement entropy, for any region. These choices are in correspondence with maximal trees of links on the boundary, which can be interpreted as partial gauge fixings. This interpretation entails a gauge fixing dependence of the entanglement entropy. In the continuum limit, however, ambiguities in the entropy are given by terms local on the boundary of the region, in such a way relative entropy and mutual information are finite, universal, and gauge independent quantities. {\copyright} 2014 American Physical Society.}

The existence of nontrivial uncertainty relations in quantum theory is generally considered to be a way in which it entails a departure from the classical worldview. However, this perspective is undermined by the fact that there exist operational theories which exhibit nontrivial uncertainty relations but which are consistent with the classical worldview insofar as they admit of a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. This prompts the question of what aspects of uncertainty relations, if any, cannot be realized in this way and so constitute evidence of genuine nonclassicality. We here consider uncertainty relations describing the tradeoff between the predictability of a pair of binary-outcome measurements (e.g., measurements of Pauli X and Pauli Z observables in quantum theory). We show that, for a class of theories satisfying a particular symmetry property, the functional form of this predictability tradeoff is constrained by noncontextuality to be below a linear curve. Because qubit quantum theory has the relevant symmetry property, the fact that its predictability tradeoff describes a section of a circle is a violation of this noncontextual bound, and therefore constitutes an example of how the functional form of an uncertainty relation can witness contextuality. We also deduce the implications for a selected group of operational foils to quantum theory and consider the generalization to three measurements.},

  abstract = {Interference phenomena are often claimed to resist classical explanation. However, such claims are undermined by the fact that the specific aspects of the phenomenology upon which they are based can in fact be reproduced in a noncontextual ontological model [Catani et al. arXiv:2111.13727]. This raises the question of what other aspects of the phenomenology of interference do in fact resist classical explanation. We answer this question by demonstrating that the most basic quantum wave-particle duality relation, which expresses the precise trade-off between path distinguishability and fringe visibility, cannot be reproduced in any noncontextual model. We do this by showing that it is a specific type of uncertainty relation, and then leveraging a recent result establishing that noncontextuality restricts the functional form of this uncertainty relation [Catani et al. arXiv:2207.11779]. Finally, we discuss what sorts of interferometric experiment can demonstrate contextuality via the wave-particle duality relation.},

  abstract = {Quantum interference phenomena are widely viewed as posing a challenge to the classical worldview. Feynman even went so far as to proclaim that they are the only mystery and the basic peculiarity of quantum mechanics. Many have also argued that basic interference phenomena force us to accept a number of radical interpretational conclusions, including: that a photon is neither a particle nor a wave but rather a Jekyll-and-Hyde sort of entity that toggles between the two possibilities, that reality is observer-dependent, and that systems either do not have properties prior to measurements or else have properties that are subject to nonlocal or backwards-in-time causal influences. In this work, we show that such conclusions are not, in fact, forced on us by basic interference phenomena. We do so by describing an alternative to quantum theory, a statistical theory of a classical discrete field (the `toy field theory') that reproduces the relevant phenomenology of quantum interference while rejecting these radical interpretational claims. It also reproduces a number of related interference experiments that are thought to support these interpretational claims, such as the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb tester, Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment, and the quantum eraser experiment. The systems in the toy field theory are field modes, each of which possesses, at all times, both a particle-like property (a discrete occupation number) and a wave-like property (a discrete phase). Although these two properties are jointly possessed, the theory stipulates that they cannot be jointly known. The phenomenology that is generally cited in favour of nonlocal or backwards-in-time causal influences ends up being explained in terms of inferences about distant or past systems, and all that is observer-dependent is the observer's knowledge of reality, not reality itself.},

The field has seen promising progress with demonstrations of early QEC and real-time decoded experiments. As quantum computers advance towards demonstrating a universal fault-tolerant logical gate set, implementing scalable and low-latency real-time decoding will be crucial to prevent the backlog problem, avoiding an exponential slowdown and maintaining a fast logical clock rate. Here, we demonstrate low-latency feedback with a scalable FPGA decoder integrated into the control system of a superconducting quantum processor. We perform an 8-qubit stability experiment with up to \$25\$ decoding rounds and a mean decoding time per round below \$1\$ \$\{{\textbackslash}mu\}s\$, showing that we avoid the backlog problem even on superconducting hardware with the strictest speed requirements. We observe logical error suppression as the number of decoding rounds is increased. We also implement and time a fast-feedback experiment demonstrating a decoding response time of \$9.6\$ \$\{{\textbackslash}mu\}s\$ for a total of \$9\$ measurement rounds. The decoder throughput and latency developed in this work, combined with continued device improvements, unlock the next generation of experiments that go beyond purely keeping logical qubits alive and into demonstrating building blocks of fault-tolerant computation, such as lattice surgery and magic state teleportation.},

An outstanding question in quantum mechanics asks how to analyze measurements distributed in time---i.e., measurements that provide information about the position at more than one time. I develop a formulation in terms of a path integral and show that it applies to a large class of measurements distributed in time. For measurements in this class, the path-integral formulation provides the joint statistics of a sequence of measurements. Specialized to the case of instantaneous position measurements, the path-integral formulation breaks down into the conventional machinery of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics: a system quantum state evolving in time according to two rules---between measurements, unitary evolution, and at each measurement, ``collapse of the wave function'' (``reduction of the state vector''). For measurements distributed in time, the path-integral formulation has no similar decomposition; the notion of a system quantum state evolving in time has no place.}

Here I take SU(1,1) interferometry apart, to see how and why it ticks. SU(1,1) interferometry arises naturally as the two-mode version of active-squeezing-enhanced, back-action-evading measurements aimed at detecting the phase-space displacement of a harmonic oscillator subjected to a classical force. Truncating an SU(1,1) interferometer, by omitting the second two-mode squeezer, leaves a prototype that uses the entanglement of two-mode squeezing to detect and characterize a disturbance on one of the two modes from measurement statistics gathered from both modes.},

We show that the entropy of a system can be described in terms of group-theoretical quantities that are largely independent of the details of its density matrix. We apply our technique to generic \$N\$ identical interacting \$d\$-level quantum systems. Using permutation invariance, we find that, for large \$N\$, entropy displays a universal large deviation behavior with a rate function \$s({\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{x\})\$ that is completely independent of the microscopic details of the model, but depends only on the size of the irreducible representations of the permutation group \${\textbackslash}text\{S\}\_N\$. In turn, the partition function is shown to satisfy a large deviation principle with a free energy \$f({\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{x\})=e({\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{x\})-{\textbackslash}beta{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}s({\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{x\})\$, where \$e({\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{x\})\$ is a rate function that only depends on the ground state energy of particular subspaces determined by group representation theory.

There can be multiple definitions of the dissension depending on the nature of projective measurements done on the subsystems. As an illustration, we explore the consequences of these multiple definitions and compare them for three-qubit pure and mixed GHZ and W states. We find that unlike discord, dissension can be negative. This is because measurement on a subsystem may enhance the correlations in the rest of the system. This approach can pave a way to generalize the notion of quantum correlations in the multiparticle setting.}

In many situations, however, \{{\textbackslash}bf where you are\} defines your identity. For example, we know the role of a bank-teller behind a bullet-proof bank window not because she shows us her credentials but by merely knowing her location. In this paper, we initiate the study of cryptographic protocols where the identity (or other credentials and inputs) of a party are derived from its {\textbackslash}emph\{geographic location\}. We start by considering the central task in this setting, i.e., securely verifying the position of a device. Despite much work in this area, we show that in the Vanilla (or standard) model, the above task (i.e., of secure positioning) is impossible to achieve. In light of the above impossibility result, we then turn to the Bounded Retrieval Model (a variant of the Bounded Storage Model) and formalize and construct information theoretically secure protocols for two fundamental tasks: {\textbackslash}begin\{itemize\} {\textbackslash}item Secure Positioning; and {\textbackslash}item Position Based Key Exchange. {\textbackslash}end\{itemize\} We then show that these tasks are in fact \{{\textbackslash}em universal{\textbackslash}/\} in this setting -- we show how we can use them to realize Secure Multi-Party Computation.

By doubling the quantum state space to a canonical phase space, we can write the joint probability density function of measurement outcomes and quantum state trajectories as a phase space path integral. Extremizing this action produces the most-likely paths with boundary conditions defined by preselected and postselected states as solutions to a set of ordinary differential equations. As an application, we analyze continuous qubit measurement in detail and examine the structure of a quantum jump in the Zeno measurement regime.},

  abstract = {We investigate notions of complexity of states in continuous many-body quantum systems. We focus on Gaussian states which include ground states of free quantum field theories and their approximations encountered in the context of the continuous version of the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz. Our proposal for quantifying state complexity is based on the Fubini-Study metric. It leads to counting the number of applications of each gate (infinitesimal generator) in the transformation, subject to a state-dependent metric. We minimize the defined complexity with respect to momentum-preserving quadratic generators which form su(1,1) algebras. On the manifold of Gaussian states generated by these operations, the Fubini-Study metric factorizes into hyperbolic planes with minimal complexity circuits reducing to known geodesics. Despite working with quantum field theories far outside the regime where Einstein gravity duals exist, we find striking similarities between our results and those of holographic complexity proposals.}

  abstract = {Finding ground states of quantum many-body systems is known to be hard for both classical and quantum computers. Consequently, when a quantum system is cooled in a low-temperature thermal bath, the ground state cannot always be found efficiently. Instead, the system may become trapped in a local minimum of the energy. In this work, we study the problem of finding local minima in quantum systems under thermal perturbations. Although local minima are much easier to find than ground states, we show that finding a local minimum is hard on classical computers, even when the task is merely to output a single-qubit observable at any local minimum. By contrast, we prove that a quantum computer can always find a local minimum efficiently using a thermal gradient descent algorithm that mimics natural cooling processes. To establish the classical hardness of finding local minima, we construct a family of two-dimensional Hamiltonians such that any problem solvable by polynomial-time quantum algorithms can be reduced to finding local minima of these Hamiltonians. Therefore, cooling systems to local minima is universal for quantum computation and, assuming that quantum computation is more powerful than classical computation, finding local minima is classically hard but quantumly easy.},

Despite the hope for practical quantum advantage in quantum simulation, popular state preparation approaches have been challenged. Monte Carlo-style quantum Gibbs samplers have emerged as an alternative, but prior proposals have been unsatisfactory due to technical obstacles rooted in energy-time uncertainty. We introduce simple continuous-time quantum Gibbs samplers that overcome these obstacles by efficiently simulating Nature-inspired quantum master equations (Lindbladians). In addition, we construct the first provably accurate and efficient algorithm for preparing certain purified Gibbs states (called thermal field double states in high-energy physics) of rapidly thermalizing systems; this algorithm also benefits from a quantum walk speedup. Our algorithms' costs have a provable dependence on temperature, accuracy, and the mixing time (or spectral gap) of the relevant Lindbladian. We complete the first rigorous proof of finite-time thermalization for physically derived Lindbladians by developing a general analytic framework for nonasymptotic secular approximation and approximate detailed balance. Given the success of classical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms and the ubiquity of thermodynamics, we anticipate that quantum Gibbs sampling will become indispensable in quantum computing.},

In contrast, perfect quantum communication does not occur when the message is sent directly from the sender to the receiver through a superposition of alternative paths, with an independent noise process acting on each path.

  abstract = {Quantum resource theories (QRTs) offer a highly versatile and powerful framework for studying different phenomena in quantum physics. From quantum entanglement to quantum computation, resource theories can be used to quantify a desirable quantum effect, develop new protocols for its detection, and identify processes that optimize its use for a given application. Particularly, QRTs revolutionize the way we think about familiar properties of physical systems like entanglement, elevating them from just being interesting from a fundamental point of view to being useful in performing practical tasks. The basic methodology of a general QRT involves partitioning all quantum states into two groups, one consisting of free states and the other consisting of resource states. Accompanying the set of free states is a collection of free quantum operations arising from natural restrictions on physical systems, and that consists of all the physical processes allowed by the resource theory and which acts invariantly on the set of free states. The QRT then studies what information processing tasks become possible using the restricted operations. Despite the large degree of freedom in how one defines the free states and free operations, unexpected similarities emerge among different QRTs in terms of resource measures and resource convertibility. As a result, objects that appear quite distinct on the surface, such as entanglement and quantum reference frames, appear to have great similarity on a deeper structural level. In this article we review the general framework of a quantum resource theory, focusing on common structural features, operational tasks, and resource measures. To illustrate these concepts, an overview is provided on some of the more commonly studied QRTs in the literature.},

  abstract = {Preparation of Gibbs distributions is an important task for quantum computation. It is a necessary first step in some types of quantum simulations and further is essential for quantum algorithms such as quantum Boltzmann training. Despite this, most methods for preparing thermal states are impractical to implement on near-term quantum computers because of the memory overheads required. Here we present a variational approach to preparing Gibbs states that is based on minimizing the free energy of a quantum system. The key insight that makes this practical is the use of Fourier series approximations to the logarithm that allows the entropy component of the free-energy to be estimated through a sequence of simpler measurements that can be combined together using classical post processing. We further show that this approach is efficient for generating high-temperature Gibbs states, within constant error, if the initial guess for the variational parameters for the programmable quantum circuit are sufficiently close to a global optima. Finally, we examine the procedure numerically and show the viability of our approach for five-qubit Hamiltonians using Trotterized adiabatic state preparation as an ansatz.},

  abstract = {We have used Ramsey tomography to characterize charge noise in a weakly charge-sensitive superconducting qubit. We find a charge noise that scales with frequency as \$1/f{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha\$ over 5 decades with \${\textbackslash}alpha = 1.93\$ and a magnitude \$S\_q({\textbackslash}text\{1Hz\})= 2.9{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}{\textasciitilde}e{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}text\{Hz\}\$. The noise exponent and magnitude of the low-frequency noise are much larger than those seen in prior work on single electron transistors, yet are consistent with reports of frequency noise in other superconducting qubits. Moreover, we observe frequent large-amplitude jumps in offset charge exceeding 0.1\$e\$; these large discrete charge jumps are incompatible with a picture of localized dipole-like two-level fluctuators. The data reveal an unexpected dependence of charge noise on device scale and suggest models involving either charge drift or fluctuating patch potentials.},

  abstract = {Quantum dynamical maps provide suitable mathematical representation of quantum evolutions. When representing quantum states by density operators, the evident requirements for any dynamical map are positivity and trace-preservation. However, these properties are not consistent with quantum mechanics of composite systems. It is the very notion of complete positivity which provides a proper mathematical representation of quantum evolution and gives rise to the powerful generalization of unitary evolution of closed Hamiltonian systems. A prominent example of quantum evolution of an open system is a Markovian semigroup. In what follows, we analyze both the semigroups of positive and completely positive maps. In the latter case the dynamics is governed by the celebrated Gorini--Kossakowski--Lindblad--Sudarshan (GKLS) Master Equation. Markovian semigroups, however, provide only an approximate description of general quantum evolution. The main topic of our analysis are dynamical maps beyond this regime. Non-Markovian quantum evolution attracted a lot of attention in recent years and there is a vast literature dedicated to it. In this report we analyze quantum dynamics governed by time-local generators and/or non-local memory kernels. A special attention is devoted to the concept of divisibility which is often used as a definition of Markovianity. In particular, the concept of so called CP-divisibility (in contrast to P-divisibility) is widely accepted as a proper definition of quantum Markovianity. We discuss a number of important physical implications of divisibility. We also briefly discuss the notion of Markovianity beyond the dynamical map, that is, when one has an access to the evolution of `system + environment'. The entire exposition is concentrated more on the general concepts and intricate connections between them than on studying particular systems. We illustrate the analyzed concepts by paradigmatic models of open quantum systems like the amplitude damping and phase damping models.},

  abstract = {We give a broad generalisation of the mapping, originally due to Dennis, Kitaev, Landahl and Preskill, from quantum error correcting codes to statistical mechanical models. We show how the mapping can be extended to arbitrary stabiliser or subsystem codes subject to correlated Pauli noise models, including models of fault tolerance. This mapping connects the error correction threshold of the quantum code to a phase transition in the statistical mechanical model. Thus, any existing method for finding phase transitions, such as Monte Carlo simulations, can be applied to approximate the threshold of any such code, without having to perform optimal decoding. By way of example, we numerically study the threshold of the surface code under mildly correlated bit-flip noise, showing that noise with bunching correlations causes the threshold to drop to \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{corr\}\}=10.04(6){\textbackslash}\%\$, from its known iid value of \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{iid\}\}=10.917(3){\textbackslash}\%\$. Complementing this, we show that the mapping also allows us to utilise any algorithm which can calculate/approximate partition functions of classical statistical mechanical models to perform optimal/approximately optimal decoding. Specifically, for 2D codes subject to locally correlated noise, we give a linear-time tensor network-based algorithm for approximate optimal decoding which extends the MPS decoder of Bravyi, Suchara and Vargo.},

The central objects to be derived and studied are the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian governing these degrees of freedom. Central concepts in classical network theory such as impedance and scattering matrices can be used to obtain the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian description for the lossless (linear) part of the circuits. Methods of analysis, both classical and quantum, can also be developed for nonreciprocal circuits.

Unlike standard memoryless CMs, we endow the bath with memory by introducing interancillary collisions between next system-ancilla interactions. Our model interpolates between a fully Markovian dynamics and the continuous interaction of the system with a single ancilla, i.e., a strongly non-Markovian process. We show that in the continuous limit one can derive a general master equation, which, while keeping such features, is guaranteed to describe an unconditionally completely positive and trace-preserving dynamics. We apply our theory to an atom in a dissipative cavity for a Lorentzian spectral density of bath modes, a dynamics which can be exactly solved. The predicted evolution shows a significant improvement in approaching the exact solution with respect to two well-known memory-kernel master equations.},

  abstract = {Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by self-adjoint operators on Hilbert space. Such ubiquitous, well-known, and very foundational fact, however, is traditionally subtle to be explained in typical first classes in quantum mechanics, as well as to senior physicists who have grown up with the lesson that self-adjointness is "just technical". The usual difficulties are to clarify the connection between the demand for certain physical features in the theory and the corresponding mathematical requirement of self-adjointness, and to distinguish between self-adjoint and hermitian operator not just at the level of the mathematical definition but most importantly from the perspective that mere hermiticity, without self-adjointness, does not ensure the desired physical requirements and leaves the theory inconsistent. In this work we organise an amount of standard facts on the physical role of self-adjointness into a coherent pedagogical path aimed at making quantum observables emerge as necessarily self-adjoint, and not merely hermitian operators. Next to the central core of our line of reasoning -- the necessity of a non-trivial declaration of a domain to associate with the formal action of an observable, and the emergence of self-adjointness as a consequence of fundamental physical requirements -- we include some complementary materials consisting of a few instructive mathematical proofs and a short retrospective, ranging from the past decades to the current research agenda, on the self-adjointness problem for quantum Hamiltonians of relevance in applications.},

We investigate a version of this where the embezzlement is perfect (i.e., the fidelity is 1). We prove that perfect embezzlement is impossible in a tensor product framework, even with infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and infinite entanglement entropy. Then we prove that perfect embezzlement is possible in a commuting operator framework. We prove this using the theory of C*-algebras and we also provide an explicit construction. Next, we apply our results to analyze perfect versions of a nonlocal game introduced by Regev and Vidick. Finally, we analyze the structure of perfect embezzlement protocols in the commuting operator model, showing that they require infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.},

  abstract = {This thesis is devoted to studying two tasks: refrigeration and the creation of correlations. In the refrigeration part, two different paradigms of cooling, namely coherent and incoherent, are defined. The connection that these paradigms have with other existing refrigeration techniques such as heat bath algorithmic cooling (HBAC), the resource theoretic approach to quantum thermodynamics, and autonomous cooling is then made. Each paradigm is then investigated on its own. This in particular allows for the derivation of a general and attainable bound. The bound is striking in its simplicity: it depends on a single parameter of the environment/machine used to cool the system of interest. The creation of correlations part is devoted to the quantitative study of how much correlations can be created for a given amount of energy. After having precisely formulated the problem of interest, we solve it for arbitrary finite dimensional bipartite systems for vanishing background temperatures. For non-vanishing background temperature the symmetry of the problem breaks down, making it much harder to tackle. When both systems are copies of each other, enough symmetry is restored to formulate an upper bound valid for all (finite) dimensional systems and prove its attainability for dimension 3 and 4. We furthermore conjecture, as well as show evidence for, the bound to be attainable in any dimension.},

  abstract = {Cooling quantum systems is arguably one of the most important thermodynamic tasks connected to modern quantum technologies and an interesting question from a foundational perspective. It is thus of no surprise that many different theoretical cooling schemes have been proposed, differing in the assumed control paradigm and complexity, and operating either in a single cycle or in steady state limits. Working out bounds on quantum cooling has since been a highly context dependent task with multiple answers, with no general result that holds independent of assumptions. In this letter we derive a universal bound for cooling quantum systems in the limit of infinite cycles (or steady state regimes) that is valid for any control paradigm and machine size. The bound only depends on a single parameter of the refrigerator and is theoretically attainable in all control paradigms. For qubit targets we prove that this bound is achievable in a single cycle and by autonomous machines.},

This relation is expressed in terms of a measure of entanglement called the "tangle," which is related to the entanglement of formation. Specifically, we show that the tangle between A and B, plus the tangle between A and C, cannot be greater than the tangle between A and the pair BC. This inequality is as strong as it could be, in the sense that for any values of the tangles satisfying the corresponding equality, one can find a quantum state consistent with those values.

Its most common formulations are known as the Aharonov--Bohm phase and the Pancharatnam and Berry phase, but both earlier and later manifestations exist. Although traditionally attributed to the foundations of quantum mechanics, the geometric phase has been generalized and become increasingly influential in many areas from condensed-matter physics and optics to high-energy and particle physics and from fluid mechanics to gravity and cosmology. Interestingly, the geometric phase also offers unique opportunities for quantum information and computation. In this Review, we first introduce the Aharonov--Bohm effect as an important realization of the geometric phase. Then, we discuss in detail the broader meaning, consequences and realizations of the geometric phase, emphasizing the most important mathematical methods and experimental techniques used in the study of the geometric phase, in particular those related to recent works in optics and condensed-matter physics.},

  abstract = {In the paradigmatic example of quantum measurements, whenever one measures a system which starts in a superposition of two states of a conserved quantity, it jumps to one of the two states, implying different final values for the quantity that should have been conserved. The standard law of conservation for quantum mechanics handles this jump by stating only that the total distribution of the conserved quantity over repeated measurements is unchanged, but states nothing about individual cases. Here however we show that one can go beyond this and have conservation in each individual instance. We made our arguments in the case of angular momentum of a particle on a circle, where many technicalities simplify, and bring arguments to show that this holds in full generality. Hence we argue that the conservation law in quantum mechanics should be rewritten, to go beyond its hitherto statistical formulation, to state that the total of a conserved quantity is unchanged in every individual measurement outcome. As a further crucial element, we show that conservation can be localised at the level of the system of interest and its relevant frame of reference, and is independent on any assumptions on the distribution of the conserved quantity over the entire universe.},

Despite advances in numerical methods to simulate the spectral properties of multi-element superconducting circuits, the literature lacks a consistent and effective method of determining the effective qubit Hamiltonian. Here we address this problem by introducing a novel local basis reduction method. This method does not require any ad hoc assumption on the structure of the Hamiltonian such as its linear response to applied fields. We numerically benchmark the local basis reduction method against other Hamiltonian reduction methods in the literature and report specific examples of superconducting qubits, including the capacitively-shunted flux qubit, where the standard reduction approaches fail. By combining the local basis reduction method with the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation we further extend its applicability to systems of interacting qubits and use it to extract both non-stoquastic two-qubit Hamiltonians and three-local interaction terms in three-qubit Hamiltonians.},

  abstract = {In the past ten years, the ideas of supersymmetry have been profitably applied to many nonrelativistic quantum mechanical problems. In particular, there is now a much deeper understanding of why certain potentials are analytically solvable and an array of powerful new approximation methods for handling potentials which are not exactly solvable. In this report, we review the theoretical formulation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and discuss many applications. Exactly solvable potentials can be understood in terms of a few basic ideas which include supersymmetric partner potentials, shape invariance and operator transformations. Familiar solvable potentials all have the property of shape invariance. We describe new exactly solvable shape invariant potentials which include the recently discovered self-similar potentials as a special case. The connection between inverse scattering, isospectral potentials and supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed and multi-soliton solutions of the KdV equation are constructed. Approximation methods are also discussed within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and in particular it is shown that a supersymmetry inspired WKB approximation is exact for a class of shape invariant potentials. Supersymmetry ideas give particularly nice results for the tunneling rate in a double well potential and for improving large \$N\$ expansions. We also discuss the problem of a charged Dirac particle in an external magnetic field and other potentials in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Finally, we discuss structures more general than supersymmetric quantum mechanics such as parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics in which there is a symmetry between a boson and a para-fermion of order \$p\$.},

  abstract = {The preparation and computation of many properties of quantum Gibbs states is essential for algorithms such as quantum semidefinite programming and quantum Boltzmann machines. We propose a quantum algorithm that can predict \$M\$ linear functions of an arbitrary Gibbs state with only \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}log\{M\})\$ experimental measurements. Our main insight is that for sufficiently large systems we do not need to prepare the \$n\$-qubit mixed Gibbs state explicitly but, instead, we can evolve a random \$n\$-qubit pure state in imaginary time. The result then follows by constructing classical shadows of these random pure states. We propose a quantum circuit that implements this algorithm by using quantum signal processing for the imaginary time evolution. We numerically verify the efficiency of the algorithm by simulating the circuit for a ten-spin-1/2 XXZ-Heisenberg model. In addition, we show that the algorithm can be successfully employed as a subroutine for training an eight-qubit fully connected quantum Boltzmann machine.},

  abstract = {An implementation of quantum absorption chillers with three qubits has been recently proposed, that is ideally able to reach the Carnot performance regime. Here we study the working efficiency of such self-contained refrigerators, adopting a consistent treatment of dissipation effects. We demonstrate that the coefficient of performance at maximum cooling power is upper bounded by 3/4 of the Carnot performance. The result is independent of the details of the system and the equilibrium temperatures of the external baths. We provide design prescriptions that saturate the bound in the limit of a large difference between the operating temperatures. Our study suggests that delocalized dissipation, which must be taken into account for a proper modelling of the machine-baths interaction, is a fundamental source of irreversibility which prevents the refrigerator from approaching the Carnot performance arbitrarily closely in practice. The potential role of quantum correlations in the operation of these machines is also investigated.},

  abstract = {An open system, even if coupled weakly to a bath, can experience a non-negligible potential renormalisation, quantified by the `reorganisation energy'. Often, the microscopic system-bath coupling gives rise to a counter term which adds to the bare Hamiltonian, exactly compensating for such potential distortion. On the other hand, when describing quantum dissipative dynamics with weak-coupling master equations, a number of `Lamb-shift terms' appear which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be neglected. And yet, the practice of vanishing both the counter term and Lamb-shift contributions is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it gives excellent results. In this paper we use a damped quantum harmonic oscillator to analytically show that subtracting the reorganisation energy from the Hamiltonian and then suppressing the Lamb-shift terms from the resulting master equation, does indeed yield an excellent approximation to the exact steady state and long-time dynamics. Put differently, those seemingly unjustified steps succeed at building the asymptotic mean-force Gibbs state -- or rather, its classical limit -- into the master equation. This can noticeably increase its accuracy, specially at moderate-to-low temperatures and even up to intermediate coupling. We thus shed light on an overlooked issue that becomes critical in the calculation of heat currents in quantum thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {A quantum computer (QC) can operate in parallel on all its possible inputs at once, but the amount of information that can be extracted from the result is limited by the phenomenon of wave function collapse. We present a new computational model, which differs from a QC only in that the result of a measurement is the expectation value of the observable, rather than a random eigenvalue thereof. Such an expectation value QC can solve nondeterministic polynomial-time complete problems in polynomial time. This observation is significant precisely because the computational model can be realized, to a certain extent, by NMR spectroscopy on macroscopic ensembles of quantum spins, namely molecules in a test tube. This is made possible by identifying a manifold of statistical spin states, called pseudo-pure states, the mathematical description of which is isomorphic to that of an isolated spin system. The result is a novel NMR computer that can be programmed much like a QC, but in other respects more closely resembles a DNA computer. Most notably, when applied to intractable combinatorial problems, an NMR computer can use an amount of sample, rather than time, which grows exponentially with the size of the problem. Although NMR computers will be limited by current technology to exhaustive searches over only 15 to 20 bits, searches over as much as 50 bits are in principle possible, and more advanced algorithms could greatly extend the range of applicability of such machines.},

We discuss the extension of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reference system to the exact theory. It is seen that such an extension, retaining some of its crucial properties, can be achieved in a special class of spacetimes, admitting non-shearing congruences of observers which, at infinity, have zero vorticity and acceleration. As applications, we consider the FLRW, Kerr and NUT spacetimes, the van Stockum rotating dust cylinder, spinning cosmic strings and, finally, we debunk the so-called Balasin-Grumiller (BG) model, and the claims that the galaxies' rotation curves can be explained through gravitomagnetic effects without the need for Dark Matter. The BG spacetime is shown to be completely inappropriate as a galactic model: its dust is actually static with respect to the asymptotic inertial frame, its gravitomagnetic effects arise from unphysical singularities along the axis (a pair of NUT rods, combined with a spinning cosmic string), and the rotation curves obtained are merely down to an invalid choice of reference frame -- the congruence of zero angular momentum observers, which are being dragged by the singularities.},

  abstract = {Essential to the description of a quantum system are its local degrees of freedom, which enable the interpretation of subsystems and dynamics in the Hilbert space. While a choice of local tensor factorization of the Hilbert space is often implicit in the writing of a Hamiltonian or Lagrangian, the identification of local tensor factors is not intrinsic to the Hilbert space itself. Instead, the only basis-invariant data of a Hamiltonian is its spectrum, which does not manifestly determine the local structure. This ambiguity is highlighted by the existence of dualities, in which the same energy spectrum may describe two systems with very different local degrees of freedom. We argue that in fact, the energy spectrum alone almost always encodes a unique description of local degrees of freedom when such a description exists, allowing one to explicitly identify local subsystems and how they interact. As a consequence, we can almost always write a Hamiltonian in its local presentation given only its spectrum. In special cases, multiple dual local descriptions can be extracted from a given spectrum, but generically the local description is unique.},

Our protocol is experimentally implemented for a Bose-Hubbard model on up to 12 sites, and we successfully extract expectation values of observables at half the temperature of the physical system.

  abstract = {The anticipated applications of quantum computers span across science and industry, ranging from quantum chemistry and many-body physics to optimization, finance, and machine learning. Proposed quantum solutions in these areas typically combine multiple quantum algorithmic primitives into an overall quantum algorithm, which must then incorporate the methods of quantum error correction and fault tolerance to be implemented correctly on quantum hardware. As such, it can be difficult to assess how much a particular application benefits from quantum computing, as the various approaches are often sensitive to intricate technical details about the underlying primitives and their complexities. Here we present a survey of several potential application areas of quantum algorithms and their underlying algorithmic primitives, carefully considering technical caveats and subtleties. We outline the challenges and opportunities in each area in an "end-to-end" fashion by clearly defining the problem being solved alongside the input-output model, instantiating all "oracles," and spelling out all hidden costs. We also compare quantum solutions against state-of-the-art classical methods and complexity-theoretic limitations to evaluate possible quantum speedups. The survey is written in a modular, wiki-like fashion to facilitate navigation of the content. Each primitive and application area is discussed in a standalone section, with its own bibliography of references and embedded hyperlinks that direct to other relevant sections. This structure mirrors that of complex quantum algorithms that involve several layers of abstraction, and it enables rapid evaluation of how end-to-end complexities are impacted when subroutines are altered.},

  abstract = {Quantum error correction (QEC) is a procedure by which the quantum state of a system is protected against a known type of noise, by preemptively adding redundancy to that state. Such a procedure is commonly used in quantum computing when thermal noise is present. Interestingly, thermal noise has also been known to play a central role in quantum thermodynamics (QTD). This fact hints at the applicability of certain QTD statements in the QEC of thermal noise, which has been discussed previously in the context of Maxwell's demon. In this article, we view QEC as a quantum heat engine with a feedback controller (i.e., a demon). We derive an upper bound on the measurement heat dissipated during the error-identification stage in terms of the Groenewold information gain, thereby providing the latter with a physical meaning also when it is negative. Further, we derive the second law of thermodynamics in the context of this QEC engine, operating with general quantum measurements. Finally, we show that, under a set of physically motivated assumptions, this leads to a fundamental triple trade-off relation, which implies a trade-off between the maximum achievable fidelity of QEC and the super-Carnot efficiency that heat engines with feedback controllers have been known to possess. A similar trade-off relation occurs for the thermodynamic efficiency of the QEC engine and the efficacy of the quantum measurement used for error identification.},

  abstract = {We argue that if the Newtonian gravitational field of a body can mediate entanglement with another body, then it should also be possible for the body producing the Newtonian field to entangle directly with on-shell gravitons. Our arguments are made by revisiting a gedankenexperiment previously analyzed by Belenchia et al., which showed that a quantum superposition of a massive body requires both quantized gravitational radiation and local vacuum fluctuations of the spacetime metric in order to avoid contradictions with complementarity and causality. We provide a precise and rigorous description of the entanglement and decoherence effects occurring in this gedankenexperiment, thereby significantly improving upon the back-of-the-envelope estimates given in the analysis of Belenchia et al. and also showing that their conclusions are valid in much more general circumstances. As a by-product of our analysis, we show that under the protocols of the gedankenexperiment, there is no clear distinction between entanglement mediated by the Newtonian gravitational field of a body and entanglement mediated by on-shell gravitons emitted by the body. This suggests that Newtonian entanglement implies the existence of graviton entanglement and supports the view that the experimental discovery of Newtonian entanglement may be viewed as implying the existence of the graviton.},

These define quantum thermodynamic variables such as quantum work and heat and characterize the possible transformations of open quantum systems. The foremost quantum thermodynamic law is a simple statement concerning the conservation of energy. Nevertheless, there exist ambiguity and disagreement regarding the precise partition of a quantum system's energy change to work and heat. By treating quantum mechanics as a comprehensive theory, applicable to both the micro and macroscopic domains, and employing dynamical symmetries, we bridge the gaps between five popular thermodynamic approaches to the first law. These include both autonomous and semi-classical formulations, which define work in terms of an ensemble average, as well as the single shot paradigm, where work is defined as a deterministic quantity.},

  abstract = {In any medium there are fluctuations due to temperature or due to the quantum nature of its constituents. If a material body is immersed into such a medium, its shape and the properties of its constituents modify the properties of the surrounding medium and its fluctuations. If in the same medium there is a second body then -- in addition to all direct interactions between them -- the modifications due to the first body influence the modifications due to the second body. This mutual influence results in a force between these bodies. If the excitations of the medium, which mediate the effective interaction between the bodies, are massless, this force is long-ranged and nowadays known as a Casimir force. If the fluctuating medium consists of the confined electromagnetic field in vacuum, one speaks of the quantum mechanical Casimir effect. In the case that the order parameter of material fields fluctuates - such as differences of number densities or concentrations - and that the corresponding fluctuations of the order parameter are long-ranged, one speaks of the critical Casimir effect. This holds, e.g., in the case of systems which undergo a second-order phase transition and which are thermodynamically located near the corresponding critical point, or for systems with a continuous symmetry exhibiting Goldstone mode excitations. Here we review the currently available exact results concerning the critical Casimir effect in systems encompassing the one-dimensional Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models, the two-dimensional Ising model, the Gaussian and the spherical models, as well as the mean field results for the Ising and the XY model. Special attention is paid to the influence of the boundary conditions on the behavior of the Casimir force.},

We take into account effects of loss of coherence and finite detection area using the propagator for a quantum particle interacting with an environment. We observe that the matter wave Gouy phase plays a role in the existence of the central peak and thus corroborates the predominantly wavelike character of the Poisson's spot.

  abstract = {The promise of quantum computers hinges on the ability to scale to large system sizes, e.g., to run quantum computations consisting of roughly more than 100 million operations fault-tolerantly. This in turn requires suppressing errors to levels inversely proportional to the size of the computation. As a step towards this ambitious goal, we present experiments on a trapped-ion QCCD processor where, through the use of fault-tolerant encoding and error correction, we are able to suppress logical error rates to levels below the physical error rates. In particular, we show Bell states encoded in the [[7,1,3]] code with error rates 9.8 to 500 times lower than at the physical level, and Bell states encoded in a [[12,2,4]] code with error rates 4.7 to 800 times lower than at the physical level, depending on the judicious use of post-selection. Moreover, we demonstrate repeated error correction with the [[12,2,4]] code, with logical error rates below physical circuit baselines corresponding to repeated CNOTs, and show evidence that the error rate per error correction cycle, which consists of over 100 physical CNOTs, approaches the error rate of two physical CNOTs. These results signify an important transition from noisy intermediate scale quantum computing to reliable quantum computing, and demonstrate advanced capabilities required for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

We show that we can observe galaxies that have, and always have had, recession velocities greater than the speed of light. We explain why this does not violate special relativity and we link these concepts to observational tests. Attempts to restrict recession velocities to less than the speed of light require a special relativistic interpretation of cosmological redshifts. We analyze apparent magnitudes of supernovae and observationally rule out the special relativistic Doppler interpretation of cosmological redshifts at a confidence level of 23 sigma.},

This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a \$Z\_2\$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence an expected phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.},

We examine three (classically equivalent) definitions of a quantum system's internal energy under strong-coupling conditions. Each internal-energy definition implies a definition of work and a definition of heat. Our study focuses on quenches, common processes in which the Hamiltonian changes abruptly. In these processes, the first law of thermodynamics holds for each set of definitions by construction. However, we prove that only two sets obey the second law. We illustrate our findings using a simple spin model. Our results guide studies of thermodynamic quantities in strongly coupled quantum systems.},

We start by critically analyzing the various approximations required to distill such a simple model from standard quantum electrodynamics. We then discuss how many of those approximations can, and often have been broken in recent experiments. The consequence of these failures has been the need to abandon the Jaynes-Cummings model for more complex models. In this, the quantum Rabi model has the most prominent role and we will rapidly survey its rich and peculiar phenomenology. We conclude the paper by showing how the Jaynes-Cummings model still plays a crucial role even in non-perturbative light-matter coupling regimes.},

  abstract = {Quantum information theory has considerably helped in the understanding of quantum many-body systems. The role of quantum correlations and in particular, bipartite entanglement, has become crucial to characterise, classify and simulate quantum many body systems. Furthermore, the scaling of entanglement has inspired modifications to numerical techniques for the simulation of many-body systems leading to the, now established, area of tensor networks. However, the notions and methods brought by quantum information do not end with bipartite entanglement. There are other forms of correlations embedded in the ground, excited and thermal states of quantum many-body systems that also need to be explored and might be utilised as potential resources for quantum technologies. The aim of this work is to review the most recent developments regarding correlations in quantum many-body systems focussing on multipartite entanglement, quantum nonlocality, quantum discord, mutual information but also other non classical measures of correlations based on quantum coherence. Moreover, we also discuss applications of quantum metrology in quantum many-body systems.}

  abstract = {The presence of non-local and long-range interactions in quantum systems induces several peculiar features in their equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium behavior. In current experimental platforms control parameters such as interaction range, temperature, density and dimension can be changed. The existence of universal scaling regimes, where diverse physical systems and observables display quantitative agreement, generates a common framework, where the efforts of different research communities can be -- in some cases rigorously -- connected. Still, the application of this general framework to particular experimental realisations requires the identification of the regimes where the universality phenomenon is expected to appear. In the present review we summarise the recent investigations of many-body quantum systems with long-range interactions, which are currently realised in Rydberg atom arrays, dipolar systems, trapped ion setups and cold atoms in cavity experiments. Our main aim is to present and identify the common and (mostly) universal features induced by long-range interactions in the behaviour of quantum many-body systems. We will discuss both the case of very strong non-local couplings, i.e. the non-additive regime, and the one in which energy is extensive, but nevertheless low-energy, long wavelength properties are altered with respect to the short-range limit. Cases of competition with other local effects in the above mentioned setups are also reviewed.},

This allows us to study how the internal dynamics of the detectors (for example the gap between the detector energy levels) have an impact on the ability of a particle detectors to communicate with one another. Moreover, we show that, very generally, even for detectors with infinite tails in space and time, if the tails decay exponentially, one can define an effective lightcone, outside of which signalling is negligible.

We proceed by first studying the relation between faster-than-light signaling and the causal factorization of the dynamics for multiple detector-field interactions. We show in what way spatially extended non-relativistic detector models predict superluminal propagation of the field's initial conditions. We draw parallels between this characteristic of detector models, stemming from their non-relativistic dynamics, and Sorkin's "impossible measurements on quantum fields" arXiv:gr-qc/9302018.

  abstract = {Algebraic approach to quantum non - separability is applied to the case of two qubits. It is based on the partition of the algebra of observables into independent subalgebras and the tensor product structure of the Hilbert space is not exploited. Even in this simple case, such general formulation has some advantages. Using algebraic formalism we can explicitly show the relativity of the notion of entanglement to the observables measured in the system and characterize separable and non - separable pure states. As a universal measure of non - separability of pure states we propose to take so called total correlation. This quantity depends on the state as well as on the algebraic partition. Its numerical value is given by the norm of the corresponding correlation matrix},

  abstract = {The second quantum revolution has been built on a foundation of fundamental research at the intersection of physics and information science, giving rise to the discipline we now call Quantum Information Science (QIS). The quest for new knowledge and understanding drove the development of new experimental tools and rigorous theory, which defined the roadmap for second-wave quantum technologies, including quantum computers, quantum-enhanced sensors, and communication systems. As technology has matured, the race to develop and commercialize near-term applications has accelerated. In the current regime of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, the continued necessity of basic research is manifest. Under what conditions can we truly harness quantum complexity and what are its implications for potential useful applications? These questions remain largely unanswered, and as the QIS industry ramps up, a continuous feedback between basic science and technology is essential. In this Perspective I review how curiosity-driven research led to radical new technologies and why the quest for basic understanding is essential for further progress.},

  abstract = {Quantum error correction (QEC) and fault-tolerant quantum computation represent one of the most vital theoretical aspect of quantum information processing. It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. This development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.},

In contrast to microscopic entities such as spins or atoms, they tend to be well coupled to other circuits, which make them appealling from the point of view of readout and gate implementation. Very recently, new designs of superconducting qubits based on multi-junction circuits have solved the problem of isolation from unwanted extrinsic electromagnetic perturbations. We discuss in this review how qubit decoherence is affected by the intrinsic noise of the junction and what can be done to improve it.},

  abstract = {Thermalization is the process through which a physical system evolves toward a state of thermal equilibrium. Determining whether or not a physical system will thermalize from an initial state has been a key question in condensed matter physics. Closely related questions are determining whether observables in these systems relax to stationary values, and what those values are. Using tools from computational complexity theory, we demonstrate that given a Hamiltonian on a finite-sized system, determining whether or not it thermalizes or relaxes to a given stationary value is computationally intractable, even for a quantum computer. In particular, we show that the problem of determining whether an observable of a finite-sized quantum system relaxes to a given value is PSPACE-complete, and so no efficient algorithm for determining the value is expected to exist. Further, we show the existence of Hamiltonians for which the problem of determining whether the system thermalizes is contained in PSPACE and is PSPACE-hard under quantum polynomial time reductions. We also present evidence that determining thermalization is PSPACE-hard under classical polynomial time reductions and state a physically reasonable conjecture under which it is PSPACE-complete. In light of recent results demonstrating undecidability of thermalization in the thermodynamic limit, our work shows that the intractability of the problem is due to inherent difficulties in many-body physics rather than particularities of infinite systems.},

  abstract = {In quantum resource theories (QRTs) certain quantum states and operations are deemed more valuable than others. While the determination of the ``free'' elements is usually guided by the constraints of some experimental setup, this can make it difficult to study similarities and differences between QRTs. In this work, we argue that QRTs follow from the choice of a preferred algebraic structure \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$ to be preserved, thus setting the free operations as the automorphisms of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$. We illustrate our finding by determining \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$ for the QRTs of entanglement, Clifford stabilizerness, purity, imaginarity, fermionic Gaussianity, reference frames, thermodynamics and coherence; showing instances where \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$ is a Lie algebra, group, ring, or even a simple set. This unified understanding allows us to generalize the concept of stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) to identify novel resource non-increasing operations for Lie-algebra based QRTs, thus finding a new solution to an open problem in the literature. We showcase the sanity of our new set of operations by rigorously proving that they map free states to free states, as well as determine more general situations where these transformations strictly do not increase the resource of a state.},

Here we investigate how microcausality and subsystem locality are related. The question is relevant for understanding whether it is possible to formulate quantum field theory in quantum information language, and has bearing on the recent discussions on low-energy tests of quantum gravity. We present a first result in this direction: in the quantum dynamics of a massive scalar quantum field coupled to two localised systems, microcausality implies subsystem locality in a physically relevant approximation.},

In the absence of interactions the lattice gas is driven into a pure state with long range order. Weak interactions lead to a weakly mixed state, which in 3D can be understood as a depletion of the condensate, and in 1D and 2D exhibits properties reminiscent of a Luttinger liquid or a Kosterlitz-Thouless critical phase at finite temperature, with the role of the ``finite temperature'' played by the interactions.},

Here, we present QuL, a programming library which can be used to generate, analyze, and test quantum circuits for various computational cooling protocols. In its most basic usage, QuL enables a novice user to easily produce cooling circuits with minimal input or knowledge required. The programming library, however, offers flexibility to more advanced users to finely tune the cooling protocol used to generate the quantum circuit. Finally, QuL offers methods to assess and compare various cooling protocols for users interested in studying optimal implementation of computational cooling in general, or on specific quantum backends. It is our hope that QuL will not only facilitate the execution of computational cooling on current quantum computers, but also serve as a tool to investigate open questions in the optimal implementation of computational cooling.},

The Quantum Technology Initiative is based on more than two years of pilot collaborations and investigations --- primarily in quantum computing --- related to possible applications that are core to activities in high-energy physics (HEP). Over the past few years, knowledge and technologies have evolved considerably; dedicated support for research and development in quantum technologies has become part of national and international research agendas. The time has come for CERN to engage more formally with such activities. Thanks to its role in HEP and more broadly in European and international scientific research, CERN has compelling requirements for its future instruments and infrastructures, which represent very valuable application use cases. This puts CERN in a unique position to catalyse interests and investigations to act as a hub for innovation and knowledge creation and sharing, and to have a long-lasting impact on applying quantum technologies to high-energy physics (HEP) and beyond. The CERN Quantum Technology Initiative has defined a medium- and long-term roadmap and research programme in collaboration with the HEP and quantum-technology research communities. Together, we will establish joint research, educational and training activities, set up the supporting resource infrastructure, and provide dedicated mechanisms for exchange of both knowledge and technology.},

  abstract = {Abstract             One of the main theoretical challenges in quantum computing is the design of explicit schemes that enable one to effectively factorize a given final unitary operator into a product of basic unitary operators. As this is equivalent to a constructive controllability task on a Lie group of special unitary operators, one faces interesting classes of bilinear optimal control problems for which efficient numerical solution algorithms are sought for. In this paper we give a review on recent Lie-theoretical developments in finite-dimensional quantum control that play a key role for solving such factorization problems on a compact Lie group. After a brief introduction to basic terms and concepts from quantum mechanics, we address the fundamental control theoretic issues for bilinear control systems and survey standard techniques fromLie theory relevant for quantum control. Questions of controllability, accessibility and time optimal control of spin systems are in the center of our interest. Some remarks on computational aspects are included as well. The idea is to enable the potential reader to understand the problems in clear mathematical terms, to assess the current state of the art and get an overview on recent developments in quantum control-an emerging interdisciplinary field between physics, control and computation.

  abstract = {Gauge invariance is the cornerstone of modern quantum field theory. Recently, it has been shown that the quantum Rabi model, describing the dipolar coupling between a two-level atom and a quantized electromagnetic field, violates this principle. This widely used model describes a plethora of quantum systems and physical processes under different interaction regimes. In the ultrastrong coupling regime, it provides predictions which drastically depend on the chosen gauge. This failure is attributed to the finite-level truncation of the matter system. We show that a careful application of the gauge principle is able to restore gauge invariance even for extreme light-matter interaction regimes. The resulting quantum Rabi Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge differs significantly from the standard model and provides the same physical results obtained by using the dipole gauge. It contains field operators to all orders that cannot be neglected when the coupling strength is high. These results shed light on subtleties of gauge invariance in nonperturbative and extreme interaction regimes, which are now experimentally accessible, and solve all the long-lasting controversies arising from gauge ambiguities in the quantum Rabi and Dicke models.},

Such systems are associated to spacelike hypersurfaces with boundaries and provide the natural setting for studying entanglement entropy of regions of space. We present a general formalism to associate a gauge-invariant classical phase space to a spatial slice with boundary by introducing new degrees of freedom on the boundary. In Yang-Mills theory the new degrees of freedom are a choice of gauge on the boundary, transformations of which are generated by the normal component of the nonabelian electric field. In general relativity the new degrees of freedom are the location of a codimension-2 surface and a choice of conformal normal frame. These degrees of freedom transform under a group of surface symmetries, consisting of diffeomorphisms of the codimension-2 boundary, and position-dependent linear deformations of its normal plane. We find the observables which generate these symmetries, consisting of the conformal normal metric and curvature of the normal connection. We discuss the implications for the problem of defining entanglement entropy in quantum gravity. Our work suggests that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy may arise from the different ways of gluing together two partial Cauchy surfaces at a cross-section of the horizon.},

  abstract = {Quantum Error Mitigation (EM) is a collection of strategies to reduce errors on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices on which proper quantum error correction is not feasible. One of such strategies aimed at mitigating noise effects of a known environment is to realise the inverse map of the noise using a set of completely positive maps weighted by a quasi-probability distribution, i.e. a probability distribution with positive and negative values. This quasi-probability distribution is realised using classical post-processing after final measurements of the desired observables have been made. Here we make a connection with quasi-probability EM and recent results from quantum trajectory theory for open quantum systems. We show that the inverse of noise maps can be realised by performing classical post-processing on the quantum trajectories generated by an additional reservoir with a quasi-probability measure called the influence martingale. We demonstrate our result on a model relevant for current NISQ devices. Finally, we show the quantum trajectories required for error correction can themselves be simulated by coupling an ancillary qubit to the system. In this way, we can avoid the introduction of the engineered reservoir.},

When the master equation is of the Lindblad--Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan form, its solution can be ``unraveled in quantum trajectories'' i.e., represented as an average over the realizations of a Markov process in the Hilbert space of the system. Quantum trajectories of this type are both an element of quantum measurement theory as well as a numerical tool for systems in large Hilbert spaces. We prove that general time-local and trace-preserving master equations also admit an unraveling in terms of a Markov process in the Hilbert space of the system. The crucial ingredient is to weigh averages by a probability pseudo-measure which we call the ``influence martingale''. The influence martingale satisfies a 1d stochastic differential equation enslaved to the ones governing the quantum trajectories. We thus extend the existing theory without increasing the computational complexity.},

These results give rise to an explicit conjecture relating hypermap enumeration to the topological recursion and we provide evidence to support this conjecture.}

For example, it was recently shown that certain linear algebra problems can be solved thermodynamically, leading to an asymptotic speedup scaling with the matrix dimension. The origin of this "thermodynamic advantage" has not yet been fully explained, and it is not clear what other problems might benefit from it. Here we provide a new thermodynamic algorithm for exponentiating a real matrix, with applications in simulating linear dynamical systems. We describe a simple electrical circuit involving coupled oscillators, whose thermal equilibration can implement our algorithm. We also show that this algorithm also provides an asymptotic speedup that is linear in the dimension. Finally, we introduce the concept of thermodynamic parallelism to explain this speedup, stating that thermodynamic noise provides a resource leading to effective parallelization of computations, and we hypothesize this as a mechanism to explain thermodynamic advantage more generally.},

It provides us with a natural framework to study theoretical models where degrees of freedom are correlated over long distances and that may exhibit very distinct behavior on different energy scales. The nonperturbative functional renormalization-group (FRG) approach is a modern implementation of Wilson's RG, which allows one to set up nonperturbative approximation schemes that go beyond the standard perturbative RG approaches. The FRG is based on an exact functional flow equation of a coarse-grained effective action (or Gibbs free energy in the language of statistical mechanics). We review the main approximation schemes that are commonly used to solve this flow equation and discuss applications in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium statistical physics, quantum many-particle systems, high-energy physics and quantum gravity.},

This classification concerns the entanglement properties of a single copy of the state. Accordingly, we say that two states have the same kind of entanglement if both of them can be obtained from the other by means of local operations and classical communcication (LOCC) with nonzero probability. When applied to pure states of a three-qubit system, this approach reveals the existence of two inequivalent kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement, for which the GHZ state and a W state appear as remarkable representatives. In particular, we show that the W state retains maximally bipartite entanglement when any one of the three qubits is traced out. We generalize our results both to the case of higher dimensional subsystems and also to more than three subsystems, for all of which we show that, typically, two randomly chosen pure states cannot be converted into each other by means of LOCC, not even with a small probability of success.},

'Reversible Computing' avoids this source of dissipation, but is dissipationless computation possible? In this paper, a general proof is given for open quantum systems showing that a computer thermally coupled to its environment will necessarily dissipate entropy (and hence heat). Specifically, a lower bound is obtained that corresponds to the adiabatic regime, in which the amount of entropy dissipated per computational operation is proportional to the rate of computation.},

  abstract = {While quantum measurements have been shown to constitute a resource for operating quantum thermal machines, the nature of the energy exchanges involved in the interaction between system and measurement apparatus is still under debate. In this work, we show that a microscopic model of the apparatus is necessary to unambiguously determine whether quantum measurements provide energy in the form of heat or work. We illustrate this result by considering a measurement-based refrigerator, made of a double quantum dot embedded in a two-terminal device, with the charge of one of the dots being continuously monitored. Tuning the parameters of the measurement device interpolates between a heat- and a work-fueled regimes with very different thermodynamic efficiency. Notably, we demonstrate a trade-off between a maximal thermodynamic efficiency when the measurement-based refrigerator is fueled by heat and a maximal measurement efficiency quantified by the signal-to-noise ratio in the work-fueled regime. Our analysis offers a new perspective on the nature of the energy exchanges occurring during a quantum measurement, paving the way for energy optimization in quantum protocols and quantum machines.},

We then numerically investigate the system at finite \$N\$ and, by analysing the level statistics, we demonstrate that the system undergoes a transition from quasi-integrability to quantum chaotic, and that this transition is caused by the precursors of the quantum phase-transition. Our considerations of the wavefunction indicate that this is connected with a delocalisation of the system and the emergence of macroscopic coherence. We also derive a semi-classical Dicke model, which exhibits analogues of all the important features of the quantum model, such as the phase transition and the concurrent onset of chaos.},

In particular, we find examples of positive semi-definite operators which have empty pre-image under the Choi formalism as soon as the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional.},

  abstract = {Quantum theory provides a significant example of two intermingling hallmarks of science: the ability to consistently combine physical systems and study them compositely; and the power to extract predictions in the form of correlations. A striking consequence of this facet is the violation of \${\textbackslash}textit\{local realism\}\$, which has been experimentally demonstrated via so-called \${\textbackslash}textit\{Bell tests\}\$. The prediction of this phenomenon originates as quantum systems are prescribed to combine according to the \${\textbackslash}textit\{composition postulate\}\$, i.e. the tensor-product rule. This rule has also an operationally sound formulation -- rather than just a purely mathematical one -- given in terms of discriminability of states via local measurements. Yet, both the theoretical and the empirical status of such postulate has been constantly challenged over the decades: is it possible to deduce it from the remaining postulates? Here, we solve this long-standing problem by answering in the negative. We formulate a family of operational theories that are solely distinguished from quantum theory by their system-composition rule, while, at the same time, they cannot be told apart by Bell-like experiments. Quantum theory is thus established to genuinely embody more content than quantum correlations. As a result, foundational programs only based on single-system principles, or on bare correlations, are operationally incomplete. On the experimental side, ascertaining the independence of postulates is a fundamental step to adjudicate between quantum theory and alternative physical theories: hence, the composition postulate deserves to be experimentally scrutinised independently of the other features of quantum theory.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the increasing connections between information theory and high-energy physics, particularly in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we explore the information geometry associated to a variety of simple systems. By studying their Fisher metrics, we derive some general lessons that may have important implications for the application of information geometry in holography. We begin by demonstrating that the symmetries of the physical theory under study play a strong role in the resulting geometry, and that the appearance of an AdS metric is a relatively general feature. We then investigate what information the Fisher metric retains about the physics of the underlying theory by studying the geometry for both the classical 2d Ising model and the corresponding 1d free fermion theory, and find that the curvature diverges precisely at the phase transition on both sides. We discuss the differences that result from placing a metric on the space of theories vs. states, using the example of coherent free fermion states. We compare the latter to the metric on the space of coherent free boson states and show that in both cases the metric is determined by the symmetries of the corresponding density matrix. We also clarify some misconceptions in the literature pertaining to different notions of flatness associated to metric and non-metric connections, with implications for how one interprets the curvature of the geometry. Our results indicate that in general, caution is needed when connecting the AdS geometry arising from certain models with the AdS/CFT correspondence, and seek to provide a useful collection of guidelines for future progress in this exciting area.},

The study of the properties of quantum light then evolved in the direction of more and more complex and rich situations, involving many modes, either spatial, temporal, frequency, or polarization modes. Actually, each mode of the electromagnetic field can be considered as an individual quantum degree of freedom. It is then possible, using the techniques of nonlinear optics, to couple different modes, and thus to build in a controlled way a quantum network in which the nodes are optical modes and that is endowed with a strong multipartite entanglement. In addition, such networks are easily reconfigurable and subject only to weak decoherence. They open indeed many promising perspectives for optical communications and computation. Because of the linearity of Maxwell equations a linear superposition of two modes is another mode. This means that a "modal superposition principle" exists hand in hand with the regular quantum state superposition principle. The purpose of the present review is to show the interest of considering these two aspects of multimode quantum light in a global way. Indeed using different sets of modes allows to consider the same quantum state under different perspectives: a given state can be entangled in one basis, factorized in another. We will show how to produce, characterize and tailor multimode quantum light. Finally we will describe some applications to quantum technologies, such as parameter estimation and measurement-based quantum computation.}

  abstract = {Quantum error correction and symmetry arise in many areas of physics, including many-body systems, metrology in the presence of noise, fault-tolerant computation, and holographic quantum gravity. Here we study the compatibility of these two important principles. If a logical quantum system is encoded into \$n\$ physical subsystems, we say that the code is covariant with respect to a symmetry group \$G\$ if a \$G\$ transformation on the logical system can be realized by performing transformations on the individual subsystems. For a \$G\$-covariant code with \$G\$ a continuous group, we derive a lower bound on the error correction infidelity following erasure of a subsystem. This bound approaches zero when the number of subsystems \$n\$ or the dimension \$d\$ of each subsystem is large. We exhibit codes achieving approximately the same scaling of infidelity with \$n\$ or \$d\$ as the lower bound. Leveraging tools from representation theory, we prove an approximate version of the Eastin-Knill theorem: If a code admits a universal set of transversal gates and corrects erasure with fixed accuracy, then, for each logical qubit, we need a number of physical qubits per subsystem that is inversely proportional to the error parameter. We construct codes covariant with respect to the full logical unitary group, achieving good accuracy for large \$d\$ (using random codes) or \$n\$ (using codes based on \$W\$-states). We systematically construct codes covariant with respect to general groups, obtaining natural generalizations of qubit codes to, for instance, oscillators and rotors. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, our approach provides insight into how time evolution in the bulk corresponds to time evolution on the boundary without violating the Eastin-Knill theorem, and our five-rotor code can be stacked to form a covariant holographic code.},

  abstract = {Detection of weak forces and precise measurement of time are two of the many applications of quantum metrology to science and technology. We consider a quantum system initialized in a pure state and whose evolution is governed by a Hamiltonian \$H\$; a measurement can later estimate the time \$t\$ for which the system has evolved. In this work, we introduce and study a fundamental trade-off which relates the amount by which noise reduces the accuracy of a quantum clock to the amount of information about the energy of the clock that leaks to the environment. Specifically, we consider an idealized scenario in which Alice prepares an initial pure state of the clock, allows the clock to evolve for a time \$t\$ that is not precisely known, and then transmits the clock through a noisy channel to Bob. The environment (Eve) receives any information that is lost. We prove that Bob's loss of quantum Fisher information (QFI) about \$t\$ is equal to Eve's gain of QFI about a complementary energy parameter. We also prove a more general trade-off that applies when Bob and Eve wish to estimate the values of parameters associated with two noncommuting observables. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the accuracy of the clock to be unaffected by the noise. These are a subset of the Knill-Laflamme error-correction conditions; states satisfying these conditions are said to form a metrological code. We provide a scheme to construct metrological codes in the stabilizer formalism. We show that there are metrological codes that cannot be written as a quantum error-correcting code with similar distance in which the Hamiltonian acts as a logical operator, potentially offering new schemes for constructing states that do not lose any sensitivity upon application of a noisy channel. We discuss applications of our results to sensing using a many-body state subject to erasure or amplitude-damping noise.},

Here, we find analogous fundamental principles identifying a noisy quantum channel \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{T\}\$ to model the system's dynamics, going beyond the study of its final equilibrium state. Our maximum channel entropy principle states that \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{T\}\$ should maximize the channel's entropy, suitably defined, subject to any available macroscopic constraints. These may correlate input and outputs, and may lead to restricted or partial thermalizing dynamics including thermalization with average energy conservation. This principle is reinforced by an independent extension of the microcanonical derivation of the thermal state to channels, which leads to the same \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{T\}\$. Our technical contributions include a derivation of the general mathematical structure of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{T\}\$, a custom postselection theorem relating an arbitrary permutation-invariant channel to nearby i.i.d. channels, as well as novel typicality results for quantum channels for noncommuting constraints and arbitrary input states. We propose a learning algorithm for quantum channels based on the maximum channel entropy principle, demonstrating the broader relevance of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{T\}\$ beyond thermodynamics and complex many-body systems.},

  abstract = {The thermal state plays a number of significant roles throughout physics, information theory, quantum computing, and machine learning. It arises from Jaynes' maximum-entropy principle as the maximally entropic state subject to linear constraints, and is also the reduced state of the microcanonical state on the system and a large environment. We formulate a maximum-channel-entropy principle, defining a thermal channel as one that maximizes a channel entropy measure subject to linear constraints on the channel. We prove that thermal channels exhibit an exponential form reminiscent of thermal states. We study examples including thermalizing channels that conserve a state's average energy, as well as Pauli-covariant and classical channels. We propose a quantum channel learning algorithm based on maximum channel entropy methods that mirrors a similar learning algorithm for quantum states. We then demonstrate the thermodynamic relevance of the maximum-channel-entropy channel by proving that it resembles the action on a single system of a microcanonical channel acting on many copies of the system. Here, the microcanonical channel is defined by requiring that the linear constraints obey sharp statistics for any i.i.d. input state, including for noncommuting constraint operators. Our techniques involve convex optimization methods to optimize recently introduced channel entropy measures, typicality techniques involving noncommuting operators, a custom channel postselection technique, as well as Schur-Weyl duality. As a result of potential independent interest, we prove a constrained postselection theorem for quantum channels. The widespread relevance of the thermal state throughout physics, information theory, machine learning, and quantum computing, inspires promising applications for the analogous concept for quantum channels.},

  abstract = {Starting at the mesoscopic level with a general formulation of stochastic thermodynamics in terms of Markov jump processes, the scaling conditions that ensure the emergence of a (typically nonlinear) deterministic dynamics and an extensive thermodynamics at the macroscopic level are identified. Large deviations theory is then used to build a macroscopic fluctuation theory around this deterministic behavior, which are shown to preserve the fluctuation theorem. For many systems (such as chemical reaction networks, electronic circuits, and Potts models), this theory does not coincide with Langevin-equation approaches (obtained by adding Gaussian white noise to the deterministic dynamics), which if used are thermodynamically inconsistent. Einstein-Onsager theory of Gaussian fluctuations and irreversible thermodynamics are recovered at equilibrium and close to it, respectively. Far from equilibirum the free energy is replaced by the dynamically generated quasipotential (or self-information), which is a Lyapunov function for the macroscopic dynamics. Thermodynamics connects the dissipation along deterministic and escape trajectories to the Freidlin-Wentzell quasipotential, thus constraining the transition rates between attractors induced by rare fluctuations. A coherent perspective on minimum and maximum entropy production principles is also provided. For systems that admit a continuous-space limit, a nonequilibrium fluctuating field theory with its associated thermodynamics is derived. Finally, the macroscopic stochastic dynamics is coarse grained into a Markov jump process describing transitions among deterministic attractors, and the stochastic thermodynamics emerging from it is formulated.},

This system can be totally governed by a two-mode Dicke-lattice model, which includes all of the counter-rotating terms and therefore works well in the ultrastrong coupling regime achieved in recent experiments. Attributed to its special atom-photon coupling scheme, this model supports a global conserved excitation and a continuous \$U(1)\$ symmetry, rather than the discrete \$Z\_\{2\}\$ symmetry in the standard Dicke-lattice model. This distinct change of symmetry via adding an extra photon mode strongly impacts the nature of photon localization/delocalization behavior. Specifically, the atom-photon interaction features stable Mott-lobe structures of photons and a second-order superfluid-Mott-insulator phase transition, which share similarities with the Jaynes-Cummings-lattice and Bose-Hubbard models. More interestingly, the Mott-lobe structures predicted here depend crucially on the atom number of each site. We also show that our model can be mapped into a continuous \$XX\$ spin model. Finally, we propose a scheme to implement the introduced cavity array in circuit quantum electrodynamics. This work broadens our understanding of strongly-correlated photons.},

The variation of entanglement entropy between two fermions from an initial state to the final state was computed, with respect to different entanglement between the ingoing particles. This variation of entanglement entropy is found to be proportional to an area quantity, the total cross section. We also study the spin-momentum and helicity-momentum entanglements within one particle in the aforementioned scattering process. The calculations of the relevant variations of mutual information in the same inertial frame reveals that, for a maximally entangled initial state, the scattering between the particles does not affect the degree of both of these entanglements of one particle in the final state. It is also found that the increasing degree of entanglement between two ingoing particles would restrict the generation of entanglement between spin (helicity) and momentum of one outgoing particle. And the entanglement between spin and momentum within one particle in the final state is shown to always be stronger than that for helicity-momentum for a general initial entanglement state, implying significantly distinct properties of entanglement for the helicity and spin perceived by an inertial observer.}

Quantum computers are an ideal platform for simulating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the collision and the formation of the subsequent many-particle state.

The scattering experiment is performed on 100 qubits of ibm\_marrakesh and uses up to 6,412 two-qubit gates to access the post-collision dynamics. Integral to these simulations is a new quantum algorithm for preparing the initial state (wavepackets) of a quantum field theory scattering simulation. This method efficiently prepares wavepackets by extending recent protocols for creating W states with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward. The required circuit depth is independent of wavepacket size and spatial dimension, representing a superexponential improvement over previous methods. Our wavepacket preparation algorithm can be applied to a wide range of lattice models and is demonstrated in one-dimensional Ising field theory, scalar field theory, the Schwinger model, and two-dimensional Ising field theory.},

In any CFT with a semiclassical holographic dual, this first law has an interpretation in the dual gravitational theory as a constraint on the spacetimes dual to CFT states. For small perturbations around the CFT vacuum state, we show that the set of such constraints for all ball-shaped spatial regions in the CFT is exactly equivalent to the requirement that the dual geometry satisfy the gravitational equations of motion, linearized about pure AdS. For theories with entanglement entropy computed by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula \$S=A/(4G\_N)\$, we obtain the linearized Einstein equations. For theories in which the vacuum entanglement entropy for a ball is computed by more general Wald functionals, we obtain the linearized equations for the associated higher-curvature theories. Using the first law, we also derive the holographic dictionary for the stress tensor, given the holographic formula for entanglement entropy. This method provides a simple alternative to holographic renormalization for computing the stress tensor expectation value in arbitrary higher derivative gravitational theories.}

  abstract = {Upcoming and planned experiments combining increasingly intense lasers and energetic particle beams will access new regimes of nonlinear, relativistic, quantum effects. This improved experimental capability has driven substantial progress in QED in intense background fields. We review here the advances made during the last decade, with a focus on theory and phenomenology. As ever higher intensities are reached, it becomes necessary to consider processes at higher orders in both the number of scattered particles and the number of loops, and to account for non-perturbative physics (e.g. the Schwinger effect), with extreme intensities requiring resummation of the loop expansion. In addition to increased intensity, experiments will reach higher accuracy, and these improvements are being matched by developments in theory such as in approximation frameworks, the description of finite-size effects, and the range of physical phenomena analysed. Topics on which there has been substantial progress include: radiation reaction, spin and polarisation, nonlinear quantum vacuum effects and connections to other fields including physics beyond the Standard Model.},

  abstract = {We propose a thermodynamic refrigeration cycle which uses Indefinite Causal Orders to achieve non-classical cooling. The cycle cools a cold reservoir while consuming purity in a control qubit. We first show that the application to an input state of two identical thermalizing channels of temperature \$T\$ in an indefinite causal order can result in an output state with a temperature not equal to \$T\$. We investigate the properties of the refrigeration cycle and show that thermodynamically, the result is compatible with unitary quantum mechanics in the circuit model but could not be achieved classically. We believe that this cycle could be implemented experimentally using tabletop photonics. Our result suggests the development of a new class of thermodynamic resource theories in which operations are allowed to be performed in an Indefinite Causal Order.},

However in current experiments, physical resource limitations like energy, volume or available bandwidth induce error rates that typically grow as the computer grows. Taking into account these constraints, we show that the amount of error correction can be opti- mized, leading to a maximum attainable computational accuracy. We find this maximum for generic situations where noise is scale-dependent. By inverting the logic, we provide experimenters with a tool to finding the minimum resources required to run an algorithm with a given computational accuracy.

  abstract = {In the race to build scalable quantum computers, minimizing the resource consumption of their full stack to achieve a target performance becomes crucial. It mandates a synergy of fundamental physics and engineering: the former for the microscopic aspects of computing performance, and the latter for the macroscopic resource consumption. For this we propose a holistic methodology dubbed Metric-Noise-Resource (MNR) able to quantify and optimize all aspects of the full-stack quantum computer, bringing together concepts from quantum physics (e.g., noise on the qubits), quantum information (e.g., computing architecture and type of error correction), and enabling technologies (e.g., cryogenics, control electronics, and wiring). This holistic approach allows us to define and study resource efficiencies as ratios between performance and resource cost. As a proof of concept, we use MNR to minimize the power consumption of a full-stack quantum computer, performing noisy or fault-tolerant computing with a target performance for the task of interest. Comparing this with a classical processor performing the same task, we identify a quantum energy advantage in regimes of parameters distinct from the commonly considered quantum computational advantage. This provides a previously overlooked practical argument for building quantum computers. While our illustration uses highly idealized parameters inspired by superconducting qubits with concatenated error correction, the methodology is universal -- it applies to other qubits and error-correcting codes -- and provides experimenters with guidelines to build energy-efficient quantum processors. In some regimes of high energy consumption, it can reduce this consumption by orders of magnitudes. Overall, our methodology lays the theoretical foundation for resource-efficient quantum technologies.},

  abstract = {Thermodynamics is based on a coarse-grained approach, from which its fundamental variables emerge, effectively erasing the complicate details of the microscopic dynamics within a macroscopic system. The strength of Thermodynamics lies in the universality provided by this paradigm. In contrast, quantum mechanics focuses on describing the dynamics of microscopic systems, aiming to make predictions about experiments we perform, a goal shared by all fundamental physical theories, which are often framed as gauge theories in modern physics. Recently, a gauge theory for quantum thermodynamics was introduced, defining gauge invariant work and heat, and exploring their connections to quantum phenomena. In this work, we extend that theory in two significant ways. First, we incorporate energy spectrum degeneracies, which were previously overlooked. Additionally, we define gauge-invariant entropy, exploring its properties and connections to other physical and informational quantities. This results in a complete framework for quantum thermodynamics grounded in the principle of gauge invariance. To demonstrate some implications of this theory, we apply it to well-known critical systems.},

This effect has been recognized as one of the most astonishing predictions of quantum field theory. At the quantum scale, the energy conversion can also occur incoherently, namely without an physical motion of the wall. We employ quantum thermodynamics to show that this phenomenon can be employed as a tool to cool down the wall when there is a non-vanishing temperature gradient between the wall and the cavity. At the same time, the process of heat-transfer enables to share the coherence from one cavity mode, driven by a laser, to the wall, thereby forcing its coherent oscillation. Finally, we show how to employ one laser drive to cool the entire system including the case when it is composed of other subsystems.},

  abstract = {Exposing a many-body system to external drives and losses can transform the nature of its phases and opens perspectives for engineering new properties of matter. How such characteristics are related to the underlying microscopic processes of the driven and dissipative system is a fundamental question. Here we address this point in a quantum gas that is strongly coupled to a lossy optical cavity mode using two independent Raman drives, which act on the spin and motional degrees of freedom of the atoms. This setting allows us to control the competition between coherent dynamics and dissipation by adjusting the imbalance between the drives. For strong enough coupling, the transition to a superradiant phase occurs, as is the case for a closed system. Yet, by imbalancing the drives we can enter a dissipation-stabilized normal phase and a region of multistability. Measuring the properties of excitations on top of the out-of-equilibrium phases reveals the microscopic elementary processes in the open system. Our findings provide prospects for studying squeezing in non-Hermitian systems, quantum jumps in superradiance, and dynamical spin-orbit coupling in a dissipative setting.}

  abstract = {We propose and develop a measurement scheme for quantum field theory (QFT) in curved spacetimes, in which the QFT of interest, the "system", is dynamically coupled to another, the "probe", in a compact spacetime region. Measurements of observables in the probe system then serve as proxy measurements of observables in the system, under a correspondence which depends also on a preparation state of the probe theory. All our constructions are local and covariant, and the conditions may be stated abstractly in the framework of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT). The induced system observables corresponding to probe observables may be localized in the causal hull of the coupling region and are typically less sharp than the probe observable, but more sharp than the actual measurement on the coupled theory. A formula is given for the post-selected system state, conditioned on measurement outcomes, which is closely related to the notion of an instrument as introduced by Davies and Lewis. This formula has the important property that individual measurements form consistent composites, provided that their coupling regions can be causally ordered and a certain causal factorisation property holds for the dynamics; the composite is independent of the causal order chosen if more than one exists. The general framework is amenable to calculation, as is shown in a specific example. This contribution reports on joint work with R. Verch, arXiv:1810.06512.},

  abstract = {The topic of measurement in relativistic quantum field theory is addressed in this article. Some of the long standing problems of this subject are highlighted, including the incompatibility of an instantaneous ``collapse of the wavefunction'' with relativity of simultaneity, and the difficulty of maintaining causality in the rules for measurement highlighted by ``impossible measurement'' scenarios. Thereafter, the issue is considered from the perspective of mathematical physics. To this end, quantum field theory is described in a model-independent, operator algebraic setting, on generic Lorentzian spacetime manifolds. The process of measurement is modelled by a localized dynamical coupling between a quantum field called the ``system'', and another quantum field, called the ``probe''. The result of the dynamical coupling is a scattering map, whereby measurements carried out on the probe can be interpreted as measurements of induced observables on the system. The localization of the dynamical coupling allows it to derive causal relations for the induced observables. It will be discussed how this approach leads to the concept of selective or non-selective system state updates conditioned on the result of probe measurements, which in turn allows it to obtain conditional probabilities for consecutive probe measurements consistent with relativistic causality and general covariance, without the need for a physical collapse of the wavefunction. In particular, the problem of impossible measurements is resolved. Finally, there is a brief discussion of accelerated detectors and other related work.},

  abstract = {The measurement process is considered for quantum field theory on curved spacetimes. Measurements are carried out on one QFT, the "system", using another, the "probe" via a dynamical coupling of "system" and "probe" in a bounded spacetime region. The resulting "coupled theory" determines a scattering map on the uncoupled combination of the "system" and "probe" by reference to natural "in" and "out" spacetime regions. No specific interaction is assumed and all constructions are local and covariant. Given any initial probe state in the "in" region, the scattering map determines a completely positive map from "probe" observables in the "out" region to "induced system observables", thus providing a measurement scheme for the latter. It is shown that the induced system observables may be localized in the causal hull of the interaction coupling region and are typically less sharp than the probe observable, but more sharp than the actual measurement on the coupled theory. Post-selected states conditioned on measurement outcomes are obtained using Davies-Lewis instruments. Composite measurements involving causally ordered coupling regions are also considered. Provided that the scattering map obeys a causal factorization property, the causally ordered composition of the individual instruments coincides with the composite instrument; in particular, the instruments may be combined in either order if the coupling regions are causally disjoint. This is the central consistency property of the proposed framework. The general concepts and results are illustrated by an example in which both "system" and "probe" are quantized linear scalar fields, coupled by a quadratic interaction term with compact spacetime support. System observables induced by simple probe observables are calculated exactly, for sufficiently weak coupling, and compared with first order perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {Quantum collision models are receiving increasing attention as they describe many nontrivial phenomena in dynamics of open quantum systems. In a general scenario of both fundamental and practical interest, a quantum system repeatedly interacts with individual particles or modes forming a correlated and structured reservoir; however, classical and quantum environment correlations greatly complicate the calculation and interpretation of the system dynamics. Here we propose an exact solution to this problem based on the tensor network formalism. We find a natural Markovian embedding for the system dynamics, where the role of an auxiliary system is played by virtual indices of the network. The constructed embedding is amenable to analytical treatment for a number of timely problems like the system interaction with two-photon wavepackets, structured photonic states, and one-dimensional spin chains. We also derive a time-convolution master equation and relate its memory kernel with the environment correlation function, thus revealing a clear physical picture of memory effects in the dynamics. The results advance tensor-network methods in the fields of quantum optics and quantum transport.},

  abstract = {Understanding fluctuations of observables across stochastic trajectories is essential for various fields of research, from quantum thermal machines to biological motors. We introduce the notion of stochastic excursions as a framework to analyze sub-trajectories of processes far from equilibrium. Given a partition of state space in two phases, labeled active and inactive, an excursion starts with a transition into the active phase and ends upon returning to inactivity. By incorporating counting variables, our approach captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, providing insights on thermodynamic trade-offs between energy expenditure, entropy production and dynamical activity. As our main result, we uncover a fundamental relation between fluctuations of counting observables at the single-excursion level and the steady state noise obtained from full counting statistics. We also show the existence of an exchange-type fluctuation theorem at the level of individual excursions. As an application, we explore how analyzing excursions yields additional insights into the operation of the three-qubit absorption refrigerator.},

Here, we extend the standard treatment of an Unruh-deWitt detector interacting with a massless, scalar field to include the detector traveling in a quantum superposition of classical trajectories. We derive perturbative expressions for the final state of the detector, and show that it depends on field correlation functions evaluated locally along the individual trajectories, as well as nonlocally between the superposed trajectories. By applying our general approach to a detector traveling in a superposition of two uniformly accelerated trajectories, including those with equal and differing proper accelerations, we discover novel interference effects in the emission and absorption spectra. These effects can be traced to causal relations between the superposed trajectories. Finally, we show that in general, such a detector does not thermalize even if the superposed paths would individually yield the same thermal state.}

The so-called ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime is established when the light-matter interaction energy is a comparable fraction of the bare frequencies of the uncoupled systems. Furthermore, when the interaction strengths become larger than the bare frequencies, the deep-strong coupling (DSC) regime emerges. This article reviews advances in the field of the USC and DSC regimes, in particular, for light modes confined in cavities interacting with two-level systems. An overview is first provided on the theoretical progress since the origins from the semiclassical Rabi model until recent developments of the quantum Rabi model. Next, several key experimental results from a variety of quantum platforms are described, including superconducting circuits, semiconductor quantum wells, and other hybrid quantum systems. Finally, anticipated applications are highlighted utilizing USC and DSC regimes, including novel quantum optical phenomena, quantum simulation, and quantum computation.},

We perform a detailed investigation of the combinatorial and geometric objects associated to these graphs. We mainly focus on their relation to polytopes and toric geometry, the Grassmannian and its stratification. Our work extends the current understanding of these connections along several important fronts, most notably eliminating restrictions imposed by planarity, positivity, reducibility and edge removability. We illustrate our ideas with several explicit examples and introduce concrete methods that considerably simplify computations. We consider it highly likely that the structures unveiled in this article will arise in the on-shell study of scattering amplitudes beyond the planar limit. Our results can be conversely regarded as an expansion in the understanding of the Grassmannian in terms of bipartite graphs.},

In this work, several recent derivations of the UP are presented, with a focus on the set of assumptions and allowed sets of operations under which the UP can be formally derived. First, we discuss derivations allowing for arbitrary unitary evolutions as the set of operations. There the aim is to provide fundamental bounds on the minimal achievable temperature, which are applicable with almost full generality. These bounds show that perfect cooling requires an infinite amount of a given resource -- worst-case work, heat bath's size and dimensionality or non-equilibrium states among others -- which can in turn be argued to imply that an infinite amount of time is required to access those resources. Secondly, we present derivations within a less general set of operations conceived to capture a broad class of currently available experimental settings. In particular, the UP is here derived within a model of linear and driven quantum refrigerators consisting on a network of harmonic oscillators coupled to several reservoirs at different temperatures.},

Taking the quantum Ising model as the paradigmatic incarnation of quantum phase transitions, we show that it exhibits quantum critical squeezing of one spin component, providing a scaling for the precision of interferometric parameter estimation which, in dimensions \$d {\textbackslash}backslashgeq 2\$, lies in between the standard quantum limit and the Heisenberg limit. Quantum critical squeezing saturates the maximum metrological gain allowed by the quantum Fisher information in \$d={\textbackslash}backslashinfty\$ (or with infinite-range interactions) at all temperatures, and it approaches closely the bound in a broad range of temperatures in \$d=2\$ and 3. This demonstrates the immediate metrological potential of equilibrium many-body states close to quantum criticality, which are accessible \${\textbackslash}backslash\$emph\{e.g.\} to atomic quantum simulators via elementary adiabatic protocols.}

However, the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters is generally limited due to the incompatibility arising from the quantum nature of the underlying system. A key question is whether quantum criticality may also play a positive role in reducing the incompatibility in the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters. We argue that this is generally the case and verify this prediction in paradigmatic quantum many-body systems close to first and second order phase transitions. The antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic 1-D Ising chain with both transverse and longitudinal fields are analysed across different regimes and close to criticality.},

It certainly does depend on the chosen inertial frame and on the initial state considered. The change of entanglement arises, because a Lorentz boost on the momenta of the particles causes a Wigner rotation of the spin, which in certain cases entangles the spin- with the momentum states. We systematically investigate the situation for different classes of initial spin states and different partitions of the 4 qubit space. Furthermore, we study the behavior of Bell inequalities for different observers and demonstrate how the maximally possible degree of violation, using the Pauli-Lubanski spin observable, can be recovered by any inertial observer.},

Here we review the theory of quantum systems with ultrastrong coupling, discussing entangled ground states with virtual excitations, new avenues for nonlinear optics, and connections to several important physical models. We also overview the multitude of experimental setups, including superconducting circuits, organic molecules, semiconductor polaritons, and optomechanical systems, that have now achieved ultrastrong coupling.

In this work, we show that a partial transpose of a bipartite density operator is a two-time pseudo-density operator, which by definition encodes temporal correlations associated with two-point sequential measurement scenarios. As such, it follows that partial transposition admits a precise physical interpretation as mapping spatial correlations to temporal correlations, thus swapping the roles of space and time for bipartite quantum systems. For maximally entangled qubits, we show that partial transposition maps spatial correlations which violate Bell inequalities to causal correlations which cannot be replicated by spacelike separated systems, thus further solidifying the interpretation of partial transpose as a space-time swap. As it is known that gravitational effects swap the roles of space and time inside a black hole, our results suggest that at a quantum mechanical level, a traversal of a black hole's event horizon by a bipartite quantum system may be described by a partial transpose.},

As opposed to holography, the real-space RG of a many-body quantum system does not have the complementary recovery property. We discuss the role of large \$N\$ and a large gap in the spectrum of operators in the emergence of complementary recovery. Second, we study the operator algebra exact quantum error correction for any von Neumann algebra.

In the first half we investigate how the Bayesian formalism can be introduced into the problem of quantum thermometry -- a field which exploits the high level of control in coherent devices to offer enhanced precision for temperature estimation. In particular, we investigate concrete estimation strategies, with focus on collisional thermometry, a protocol where a series of ancillae are sent sequentially to probe the system's temperature. We put forth a complete framework for analyzing collisional thermometry using Bayesian inference. The approach is easily implementable and experimentally friendly. Moreover, it is guaranteed to always saturate the Cram{\textbackslash}'er-Rao bound in the long-time limit. Subtleties concerning the prior information about the system's temperature are also discussed and analyzed in terms of a modified Cram{\textbackslash}'er-Rao bound associated with Van Trees and Sch{\textbackslash}"utzenberger. Meanwhile, in the last part of the thesis we approach the problem of non-adiabatic holonomic computation. Namely, we investigate the implementation based on \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$-systems. It is known that a three-level system can be used in a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$-type configuration in order to construct a universal set of quantum gates through the use of non-Abelian nonadiabatic geometrical phases. Such construction allows for high-speed operation times which diminish the effects of decoherence. This might be, however, accompanied by a breakdown of the validity of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) due to the comparable timescale between counter-rotating terms and the pulse length, which greatly affects the dynamics. Here, we investigate the trade-off between dissipative effects and the RWA validity, obtaining the optimal regime for the operation of the holonomic quantum gates.},

In particular, we find that the notion of localization is different between the two models, and leads to distinct predictions, which we study by comparing the spontaneous emission rates for the UDW detector interacting with a massless scalar field. Furthermore, we consider the UDW system in both a vacuum and medium, and compare our results to existing models describing a classical or quantized c.m. at low energies. We find that the predictions of each model, including the two relativistic cases, can in principle be empirically distinguished, and our results can be further extended to find optimal detector states and processes to perform such experiments.

  abstract = {We propose a Lie-algebraic duality approach to analyze non-equilibrium evolution of closed dynamical systems and thermodynamics of interacting quantum lattice models (formulated in terms of Hubbard-Stratonovich dynamical systems). The first part of the paper utilizes a geometric Hilbert-space-invariant formulation of unitary time-evolution, where a quantum Hamiltonian is viewed as a trajectory in an abstract Lie algebra, while the sought-after evolution operator is a trajectory in a dynamic group, generated by the algebra via exponentiation. The evolution operator is uniquely determined by the time-dependent dual generators that satisfy a system of differential equations, dubbed here dual Schrodinger-Bloch equations, which represent a viable alternative to the conventional Schrodinger formulation. These dual Schrodinger-Bloch equations are derived and analyzed on a number of specific examples. It is shown that deterministic dynamics of a closed classical dynamical system occurs as action of a symmetry group on a classical manifold and is driven by the same dual generators as in the corresponding quantum problem. This represents quantum-to-classical correspondence. In the second part of the paper, we further extend the Lie algebraic approach to a wide class of interacting many-particle lattice models. A generalized Hubbard-Stratonovich transform is proposed and it is used to show that the thermodynamic partition function of a generic many-body quantum lattice model can be expressed in terms of traces of single-particle evolution operators governed by the dynamic Hubbard-Stratonovich fields. Finally, we derive Hubbard-Stratonovich dynamical systems for the Bose-Hubbard model and a quantum spin model and use the Lie-algebraic approach to obtain new non-perturbative dual descriptions of these theories.},

  abstract = {The controllability of current quantum technologies allows to implement spin-boson models where two-photon couplings are the dominating terms of light-matter interaction. In this case, when the coupling strength becomes comparable with the characteristic frequencies, a spectral collapse can take place, i.e. the discrete system spectrum can collapse into a continuous band. Here, we analyze the thermodynamic limit of the two-photon Dicke model, which describes the interaction of an ensemble of qubits with a single bosonic mode. We find that there exists a parameter regime where two-photon interactions induce a superradiant phase transition, before the spectral collapse occurs. Furthermore, we extend the mean-field analysis by considering second-order quantum fluctuations terms, in order to analyze the low-energy spectrum and compare the critical behavior with the one-photon case.},

  abstract = {The microscopic laws of physics are symmetric under time reversal. Yet, most natural processes that we observe are not. The emergent asymmetry between typical and time-reversed processes is referred to as the arrow of time. In quantum physics, an arrow of time emerges when a sequence of measurements is performed on a system. We introduce quantum control tools that can yield dynamics more consistent with time flowing backward than forward. The control tools are based on the explicit construction of a Hamiltonian that can replicate the stochastic trajectories of a monitored quantum system. Such Hamiltonian can reverse the effect of monitoring and, via a feedback process, generate trajectories consistent with a reversed arrow of time. We show how to exploit the feedback process to design a continuous measurement engine that draws energy from the monitoring process, or to simulate the backward-in-time dynamics of an open quantum system.},

We derive the fundamental precision limit, the extended channel quantum Cram{\textbackslash}'er-Rao bound, and the optimal protocol that attains it. In the experimentally relevant regime where losses dominate, we prove that non-Gaussian state preparation and measurements are required for optimality.

How to produce, manipulate and enhance magic remains mysterious, such that concrete examples of physical systems that manifest magic behaviour are sought after. In this paper, we study two-particle scattering of gluons and gravitons in Yang--Mills theory and General Relativity, as well as their supersymmetric extensions. This provides an interesting case of two-qubit systems, differing only in the physical spin of the qubits. We show that magic is generically produced in both theories, and also show that magic typically decreases as the spin of the qubits increases. The maximal magic in each case is found to be substantially less than the known upper bound. Differences in the profile of magic generation can be traced to the known physics of each theory, as manifested in relations between their respective scattering amplitudes. Our case study may provide useful insights into understanding magic in other systems.},

This approach creates an effective Hamiltonian that reveals the cooperative effect of the baths on the system. For a spin impurity coupled to both dissipative and decoherring environments, the effective Hamiltonian predicts the suppression of relaxation by decoherence -- a phenomenon previously observed in simulations but lacking a theoretical foundation. We also apply the method to an ensemble of spins coupled to local baths through noncommuting operators, demonstrating the engineering of the Kitaev XY spin chain interaction. Noncommutativity is a feature of quantum systems; future prospects of our approach include the study of thermal machines that leverage such genuine quantum effects.},

  abstract = {The existence of zero-dimensional superradiant quantum phase transitions seems inconsistent with conventional statistical physics. This work clarifies this apparent inconsistency. We demonstrate the corresponding effective field theories and finite-temperature properties of light-matter interacting systems, and show how this zero-dimensional quantum phase transition occurs. We first focus on the Rabi model, which is a minimum model that hosts a superradiant quantum phase transition. With the path integral method, we derive the imaginary-time action of the photon degrees of freedom. We also define a dynamical critical exponent as the rescaling between the temperature and the photon frequency, and perform dimensional analysis to the effective action. The dynamical critical exponent shows that the effective theory of the Rabi model is a free scalar field, where a true second-order quantum phase transition emerges. These results are also verified by numerical simulations of imaginary-time correlation functions of the order parameter. Furthermore, we also generalize this method to the Dicke model. Our results make the zero-dimensional superradiant quantum phase transition compatible with conventional statistical physics, and pave the way to understand it in the perspective of effective field theories.},

  abstract = {Whether to reset qubits, or not, during quantum error correction experiments is a question of both foundational and practical importance for quantum computing. Text-book quantum error correction demands that qubits are reset after measurement. However, fast qubit reset has proven challenging to execute at high fidelity. Consequently, many cutting-edge quantum error correction experiments are opting for the no-reset approach, where physical reset is not performed. It has recently been postulated that no-reset is functionally equivalent to reset procedures, as well as being faster and easier. For memory experiments, we confirm numerically that resetting provides no benefit. On the other hand, we identify a remarkable difference during logical operations. We find that unconditionally resetting qubits can reduce the duration of fault-tolerant logical operation by up to a factor of two as the number of measurement errors that can be tolerated is doubled. We support this with numerical simulations. However, our simulations also reveal that the no-reset performance is superior if the reset duration and infidelity exceed given thresholds. For example, with the noise model we considered, we find the no-reset performance to be superior when the reset duration is greater than approximately 100 ns and the physical error probability is greater than approximately 10-2.5 {$\approx$} 0.003. Lastly, we introduce two novel syndrome extraction circuits that can reduce the time overhead of no-reset approaches. Our findings provide guidance on how experimentalists should design future experiments.},

LowMC key recovery then allows to forge signatures for the calling Picnic post-quantum signature scheme. We target the NIST reference implementation executed on a FRDM-K66F development board.

Our results are consistent with concepts for the emergence of time where interaction has been taken into account at the expense of a semiclassical treatment of the environment.

Quantum simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also with simpler, analog devices that would require less control, and therefore, would be easier to construct.

  abstract = {To build a universal quantum computer from fragile physical qubits, effective implementation of quantum error correction (QEC) is an essential requirement and a central challenge. Existing demonstrations of QEC are based on a schedule of discrete error syndrome measurements and adaptive recovery operations. These active routines are hardware intensive, prone to introducing and propagating errors, and expected to consume a vast majority of the processing power in a large-scale quantum computer. In principle, QEC can be realized autonomously and continuously by tailoring dissipation within the quantum system, but this strategy has remained challenging so far. Here we encode a logical qubit in Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger cat-like multiphoton states of a superconducting cavity, and demonstrate a corrective dissipation process that directly stabilizes an error syndrome operator: the photon number parity. Implemented with continuous-wave control fields only, this passive protocol realizes autonomous correction against single-photon loss and boosts the coherence time of the multiphoton qubit by over a factor of two. Notably, QEC is realized in a modest hardware setup with neither high-fidelity readout nor fast digital feedback, in contrast to the technological sophistication required for prior QEC demonstrations. Compatible with other error suppression and phase stabilization techniques, our experiment suggests reservoir engineering as a resource-efficient alternative or supplement to active QEC in future quantum computing architectures.},

  abstract = {The concept of a quantum heat pump is proposed as a convenient model in the thermodynamic interpretation of certain multilevel processes. The ideal quantum heat engine is defined as an idealization of realistic pumped multilevel systems in much the same way that the well-known Carnot cycle is an idealization of physically realizable, classical processes or engines. There is evidence that the conventional Carnot cycle can be operated only between reservoirs at absolute temperatures of identical sign. No such restriction applies, however, to the quantum heat engine. Thus it may be used to calibrate negative absolute temperatures by relating them directly to positive temperatures. Negative efficiencies or efficiencies greater than unity have particularly simple interpretations in the quantum-heat-engine model. An important application of these concepts is in the calculation of optical maser parameters.}

Ambitwistor space is the space of complex null geodesics in complexified Minkowski space, and in contrast to earlier ambitwistor strings, we use twistors rather than vectors to represent this space. Although superficially similar to the original twistor string theories of Witten, Berkovits, and Skinner, these theories differ in the assignment of world sheet spins of the fields, rely on both twistor and dual twistor representatives for the vertex operators, and use the ambitwistor procedure for calculating correlation functions. Our models are much more flexible, no longer requiring maximal supersymmetry, and the resulting formulas for amplitudes are simpler, having substantially reduced moduli. These are supported on the solutions to the scattering equations refined according to helicity and can be checked by comparison with corresponding formulas of Witten and of Cachazo and Skinner. {\copyright} 2014 American Physical Society.}

  abstract = {Quasiprobabilities are mathematical quantities describing the statistics of measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times, which incorporate the incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured quantum system. In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation and properties of the main quasiprobabilities known in the literature. We also discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution, ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. Once defined the fundamental concepts following the standpoint of joint measurability in quantum mechanics, we illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat, and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium non-driven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum information, sensitivity to local perturbations, quantum work statistics in the quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions, for instance the Ising model with a transverse field. Throughout the tutorial, we meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate learning.},

  abstract = {Recently, Hastings \& Haah introduced a quantum memory defined on the honeycomb lattice. Remarkably, this honeycomb code assembles weight-six parity checks using only two-local measurements. The sparse connectivity and two-local measurements are desirable features for certain hardware, while the weight-six parity checks enable robust performance in the circuit model. In this work, we quantify the robustness of logical qubits preserved by the honeycomb code using a correlated minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder. Using Monte Carlo sampling, we estimate the honeycomb code's threshold in different error models, and project how efficiently it can reach the "teraquop regime" where trillions of quantum logical operations can be executed reliably. We perform the same estimates for the rotated surface code, and find a threshold of \$0.2{\textbackslash}\%-0.3{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the honeycomb code compared to a threshold of \$0.5{\textbackslash}\%-0.7{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the surface code in a controlled-not circuit model. In a circuit model with native two-body measurements, the honeycomb code achieves a threshold of \$1.5{\textbackslash}\% {$<$} p {$<$}2.0{\textbackslash}\%\$, where \$p\$ is the collective error rate of the two-body measurement gate - including both measurement and correlated data depolarization error processes. With such gates at a physical error rate of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, we project that the honeycomb code can reach the teraquop regime with only \$600\$ physical qubits.},

In Gidney+Eker\{{\textbackslash}aa\} 2019, I co-published an estimate stating that 2048 bit RSA integers could be factored in eight hours by a quantum computer with 20 million noisy qubits. In this paper, I substantially reduce the number of qubits required. I estimate that a 2048 bit RSA integer could be factored in less than a week by a quantum computer with less than a million noisy qubits. I make the same assumptions as in 2019: a square grid of qubits with nearest neighbor connections, a uniform gate error rate of \$0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$, a surface code cycle time of 1 microsecond, and a control system reaction time of \$10\$ microseconds. The qubit count reduction comes mainly from using approximate residue arithmetic (Chevignard+Fouque+Schrottenloher 2024), from storing idle logical qubits with yoked surface codes (Gidney+Newman+Brooks+Jones 2023), and from allocating less space to magic state distillation by using magic state cultivation (Gidney+Shutty+Jones 2024). The longer runtime is mainly due to performing more Toffoli gates and using fewer magic state factories compared to Gidney+Eker\{{\textbackslash}aa\} 2019. That said, I reduce the Toffoli count by over 100x compared to Chevignard+Fouque+Schrottenloher 2024.},

We do so via a "temporary logical-AND" construction which uses four T gates to store the logical-AND of two qubits into an ancilla and zero T gates to later erase the ancilla. This construction is equivalent to one by Jones, except that our framing makes it clear that the technique is far more widely applicable than previously realized. Temporary logical-ANDs can be applied to integer arithmetic, modular arithmetic, rotation synthesis, the quantum Fourier transform, Shor's algorithm, Grover oracles, and many other circuits. Because T gates dominate the cost of quantum computation based on the surface code, and temporary logical-ANDs are widely applicable, this represents a significant reduction in projected costs of quantum computation. In addition to our n-bit adder, we present an n-bit controlled adder circuit with T-count of 8n + O(1), a temporary adder that can be computed for the same cost as the normal adder but whose result can be kept until it is later uncomputed without using T gates, and discuss some other constructions whose T-count is improved by the temporary logical-AND.},

This paper sets out to rectify this lack: using the recently developed tools of quantum singular value transformation and oblivious amplitude amplification, we provide a quantum algorithm to implement the Petz recovery channel when given the ability to perform the channel that one wishes to reverse. Moreover, we prove that, in some sense, our quantum algorithm's usage of the channel implementation cannot be improved by more than a quadratic factor. Our quantum algorithm also provides a procedure to perform pretty good measurements when given multiple copies of the states that one is trying to distinguish.},

Motivated by a connection to non-local quantum computation and position-based cryptography, CDS with quantum resources has recently been considered. Here, we study the differences between quantum and classical CDS, with the aims of clarifying the power of quantum resources in information-theoretic cryptography. We establish the following results: 1) For perfectly correct CDS, we give a separation for a promise version of the not-equals function, showing a quantum upper bound of \$O({\textbackslash}log n)\$ and classical lower bound of \${\textbackslash}Omega(n)\$. 2) We prove a \${\textbackslash}Omega({\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}mathsf\{R\}\_\{0,A{\textbackslash}rightarrow B\}(f)+{\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}mathsf\{R\}\_\{0,B{\textbackslash}rightarrow A\}(f))\$ lower bound on quantum CDS where \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{R\}\_\{0,A{\textbackslash}rightarrow B\}(f)\$ is the classical one-way communication complexity with perfect correctness. 3) We prove a lower bound on quantum CDS in terms of two round, public coin, two-prover interactive proofs. 4) We give a logarithmic upper bound for quantum CDS on forrelation, while the best known classical algorithm is linear. We interpret this as preliminary evidence that classical and quantum CDS are separated even with correctness and security error allowed. We also give a separation for classical and quantum private simultaneous message passing for a partial function, improving on an earlier relational separation. Our results use novel combinations of techniques from non-local quantum computation and communication complexity.},

These advances have opened up the study of quantum optics of microwave photons in superconducting circuits as well as providing important hardware for the manipulation of quantum information. Focusing primarily on charge-based qubits, we provide a brief overview of these developments and discuss the present state of the art. We also survey the remarkable progress that has been made in realizing circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) in which superconducting artificial atoms are strongly coupled to individual microwave photons.},

  abstract = {Naive attempts to put together relativity and quantum measurements lead to signaling between space-like separated regions. In QFT, these are known as impossible measurements. We show that the same problem arises in non-relativistic quantum physics, where joint nonlocal measurements (i.e., between systems kept spatially separated) in general lead to signaling, while one would expect no-signaling (based for instance on the principle of no-nonphysical communication). This raises the question: Which nonlocal quantum measurements are physically possible? We review and develop further a non-relativistic quantum information approach developed independently of the impossible measurements in QFT, and show that these two have been addressing virtually the same problem. The non-relativistic solution shows that all nonlocal measurements are localizable (i.e., they can be carried out at a distance without violating no-signaling) but they (i) may require arbitrarily large entangled resources and (ii) cannot in general be ideal, i.e., are not immediately reproducible. These considerations could help guide the development of a complete theory of measurement in QFT.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new renormalization procedure for Hamiltonians such as those of light-front field theory. The bare Hamiltonian with an arbitrarily large, but finite cutoff, is transformed by a specially chosen similarity transformation. The similarity transformation has two desirable features. First, the transformed Hamiltonian is band diagonal: in particular, all matrix elements vanish which would otherwise have caused transitions with big energy jumps, such as from a state of bounded energy to a state with an energy of the order of the cutoff. At the same time, neither the similarity transformation nor the transformed Hamiltonian, computed in perturbation theory, contain vanishing or near-vanishing energy denominators. Instead, energy differences in denominators can be replaced by energy sums for purposes of order of magnitude estimates needed to determine cutoff dependences. These two properties make it possible to determine relatively easily the list of counterterms needed to obtain finite low energy results (such as for eigenvalues). A simple model Hamiltonian is discussed to illustrate the method.}

There are a number of new elements in formulating EFTs for such systems. Firstly, the nature of IR variables is very different from those of a system in equilibrium or near the vacuum. Secondly, while all static properties of an equilibrium system can in principle be extracted from the partition function, there appears no such quantity which can capture all non-equilibrium properties. Thirdly, non-equilibrium processes often involve dissipation, which is notoriously difficult to deal with using an action principle. The purpose of the review is to explain how to address these issues in a pedagogic manner, with fluctuating hydrodynamics as a main example.},

Yet, in experiments we often measure dynamical correlations, which involve probing operators that are also separated in time. Here, we introduce a space-time generalization of mutual information which, by construction, satisfies several natural properties of the mutual information and at the same time characterizes correlations across subsystems that are separated in time. In particular, this quantity, that we call the {\textbackslash}emph\{space-time mutual information\}, bounds all dynamical correlations. We construct this quantity based on the idea of the quantum hypothesis testing. As a by-product, our definition provides a transparent interpretation in terms of an experimentally accessible setup. We draw connections with other notions in quantum information theory, such as quantum channel discrimination. Finally, we study the behavior of the space-time mutual information in several settings and contrast its long-time behavior in many-body localizing and thermalizing systems.},

  abstract = {Recent years have enjoyed an overwhelming interest in quantum thermodynamics, a field of research aimed at understanding thermodynamic tasks performed in the quantum regime. Further progress, however, seems to be obstructed by the lack of experimental implementations of thermal machines in which quantum effects play a decisive role. In this work, we introduce a blueprint of quantum field machines, which - once experimentally realized - would fill this gap. Even though the concept of the QFM presented here is very general and can be implemented in any many body quantum system that can be described by a quantum field theory. We provide here a detailed proposal how to realize a quantum machine in one-dimensional ultra-cold atomic gases, which consists of a set of modular operations giving rise to a piston. These can then be coupled sequentially to thermal baths, with the innovation that a quantum field takes up the role of the working fluid. In particular, we propose models for compression on the system to use it as a piston, and coupling to a bath that gives rise to a valve controlling heat flow. These models are derived within Bogoliubov theory, which allows us to study the operational primitives numerically in an efficient way. By composing the numerically modelled operational primitives we design complete quantum thermodynamic cycles that are shown to enable cooling and hence giving rise to a quantum field refrigerator. The active cooling achieved in this way can operate in regimes where existing cooling methods become ineffective. We describe the consequences of operating the machine at the quantum level and give an outlook of how this work serves as a road map to explore open questions in quantum information, quantum thermodynamic and the study of non-Markovian quantum dynamics.}

This has motivated the study of thermodynamically inspired approaches to ground-state preparation that aim to replicate cooling processes via imaginary-time evolution. However, synthesizing quantum circuits that efficiently implement imaginary-time evolution is itself difficult, with prior proposals generally adopting heuristic variational approaches or using deep block encodings. Here, we use the insight that quantum imaginary-time evolution is a solution of Brockett's double-bracket flow and synthesize circuits that implement double-bracket flows coherently on the quantum computer. We prove that our Double-Bracket Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution (DB-QITE) algorithm inherits the cooling guarantees of imaginary-time evolution. Concretely, each step is guaranteed to i) decrease the energy of an initial approximate ground-state by an amount proportion to the energy fluctuations of the initial state and ii) increase the fidelity with the ground-state. Thus DB-QITE provides a means to systematically improve the approximation of a ground-state using shallow circuits.},

  abstract = {Classical simulation of quantum dynamics plays an important role in our understanding of quantum complexity, and in the development of quantum technologies. Compared to other techniques for efficient classical simulations, methods relying on the Lie-algebraic structure of quantum dynamics have received relatively little attention. At their core, these simulations leverage the underlying Lie algebra - and the associated Lie group - of a dynamical process. As such, rather than keeping track of the individual entries of large matrices, one instead keeps track of how its algebraic decomposition changes during the evolution. When the dimension of the algebra is small (e.g., growing at most polynomially in the system size), one can leverage efficient simulation techniques. In this work, we review the basis for such methods, presenting a framework that we call "\${\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\$-sim", and showcase their efficient implementation in several paradigmatic variational quantum computing tasks. Specifically, we perform Lie-algebraic simulations to train and optimize parametrized quantum circuits, design enhanced parameter initialization strategies, solve tasks of quantum circuit synthesis, and train a quantum-phase classifier.},

When the order in which the channels are traversed is controlled by an auxiliary quantum system, various unknown parameters of the channels can be estimated by measuring only the control system, even when the state of the probe alone would be insensitive. Moreover, increasing the dimension of the control system increases the number of simultaneously estimable parameters, which has important metrological ramifications. We demonstrate this capability for simultaneously estimating both unitary and noise parameters, including multiple parameters from the same unitary such as rotation angles and axes and from noise channels such as depolarization, dephasing, and amplitude damping in arbitrary dimensions. We identify regimes of unlimited advantages, taking the form of \$p{\textasciicircum}2\$ smaller variances in estimation when the noise probability is \$1-p\$, for both single and multiparameter estimation when using our schemes relative to any comparable scheme whose causal order is definite.},

The Lindbladian consists of a "Hamiltonian" term which is the sum of a scaling and a coarse-graining (disentangling) operator, and a dissipative term with absorption and emission rates for each momentum mode. We consider as examples the flow of Gaussian states and the perturbative ground state of \${\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}4\$ theory, and highlight the role of the dissipative terms in generating the correct flow of couplings. Integrating the Lindblad master equation, we find that a finite ERG flow of density matrices is described by a quantum channel.

Through nondestructive local probe measurements, we introduce an alternative to destructive techniques for mapping BEC entanglement. Operating at ultralow temperatures, the setup emulates a relativistic vacuum field, using lasers as Unruh-DeWitt detectors for phonons. The vacuum holds intrinsic entanglement, transferable to distant probes briefly interacting with it - a phenomenon termed ``entanglement harvesting''. Our study accomplishes two primary objectives: first, establishing a mathematical equivalence between a pair of pulsed laser probes interacting with an effective relativistic field and the entanglement harvesting protocol; and second, to closely examine the potential and persisting obstacles for realising this protocol in an ultra-cold atom experiment.},

  abstract = {Quantum states are very delicate, so it is likely some sort of quantum error correction will be necessary to build reliable quantum computers. The theory of quantum error-correcting codes has some close ties to and some striking differences from the theory of classical error-correcting codes. Many quantum codes can be described in terms of the stabilizer of the codewords. The stabilizer is a finite Abelian group, and allows a straightforward characterization of the error-correcting properties of the code. The stabilizer formalism for quantum codes also illustrates the relationships to classical coding theory, particularly classical codes over GF(4), the finite field with four elements. To build a quantum computer which behaves correctly in the presence of errors, we also need a theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation, instructing us how to perform quantum gates on qubits which are encoded in a quantum error-correcting code. The threshold theorem states that it is possible to create a quantum computer to perform an arbitrary quantum computation provided the error rate per physical gate or time step is below some constant threshold value.},

In the setting of quantum optics, fault-tolerant universal quantum computation can be executed on the protected code subspace using linear optical operations, squeezing, homodyne detection, and photon counting; however, nonlinear mode coupling is required for the preparation of the encoded states.

A formalism describing the evolution of operators rather than states has proven extremely fruitful in understanding an important class of quantum operations.

  abstract = {We review recent work on the foundations of thermodynamics in the light of quantum information theory. We adopt a resource-theoretic perspective, wherein thermodynamics is formulated as a theory of what agents can achieve under a particular restriction, namely, that the only state preparations and transformations that they can implement for free are those that are thermal at some fixed temperature. States that are out of thermal equilibrium are the resources. We consider the special case of this theory wherein all systems have trivial Hamiltonians (that is, all of their energy levels are degenerate). In this case, the only free operations are those that add noise to the system (or implement a reversible evolution) and the only nonequilibrium states are states of informational nonequilibrium, that is, states that deviate from the maximally mixed state. The degree of this deviation we call the state's nonuniformity; it is the resource of interest here, the fuel that is consumed, for instance, in an erasure operation. We consider the different types of state conversion: exact and approximate, single-shot and asymptotic, catalytic and noncatalytic. In each case, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for the conversion to be possible for any pair of states, emphasizing a geometrical representation of the conditions in terms of Lorenz curves. We also review the problem of quantifying the nonuniformity of a state, in particular through the use of generalized entropies. Quantum state conversion problems in this resource theory can be shown to be always reducible to their classical counterparts, so that there are no inherently quantum-mechanical features arising in such problems. This body of work also demonstrates that the standard formulation of the second law of thermodynamics is inadequate as a criterion for deciding whether or not a given state transition is possible.},

  abstract = {Structure in the Universe is widely believed to have originated from quantum fluctuations during an early epoch of accelerated expansion. Yet, the patterns we observe today do not distinguish between quantum or classical primordial fluctuations; current cosmological data is consistent with either possibility. We argue here that a detection of primordial non-Gaussianity can resolve the present situation, and provide a litmus-test for the quantum origin of cosmic structure. Unlike in quantum mechanics, vacuum fluctuations cannot arise in classical theories and therefore long-range classical correlations must result from (real) particles in the initial state. Similarly to flat-space scattering processes, we show how basic principles require these particles to manifest themselves as poles in the \$n\$-point functions, in the so-called folded configurations. Following this observation, and assuming fluctuations are (i) correlated over large scales, and (ii) generated by local evolution during an inflationary phase, we demonstrate that: the absence of a pole in the folded limit of non-Gaussian correlators uniquely identifies the quantum vacuum as the initial state. In the same spirit as Bell's inequalities, we discuss how this can be circumvented if locality is abandoned. We also briefly discuss the implications for simulations of a non-Gaussian universe.},

We introduce a boundary of the anti-deSitter space analogous to a cut-off on the Liouville coordinate of the two-dimensional string theory. Correlation functions of operators in the gauge theory are related to the dependence of the supergravity action on the boundary conditions. From the quadratic terms in supergravity we read off the anomalous dimensions. For operators that couple to massless string states it has been established through absorption calculations that the anomalous dimensions vanish, and we rederive this result. The operators that couple to massive string states at level n acquire anomalous dimensions that grow as 2(ngYM{\textsurd}2N)1/2 for large 't Hooft coupling.

We then discuss the criterion that allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our proposed criterion.},

Unlike in standard thermodynamics, where the second law places a constraint on how much of the conserved quantity (energy) that can be extracted, here, on the contrary, there is no limit on how much of any individual conserved quantity that can be extracted. However, other conserved quantities must be supplied, and the second law constrains the combination of extractable quantities and the trade-offs between them which are allowed.

Fermions follow the Pauli exclusion principle, stating that two or more identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state. Antisymmetry of the fermionic wavefunction, however, implies additional constraints on the natural occupation numbers. These constraints depend on the dimensionality and purity of the system and have so far not been explored experimentally. Here, we propose an experiment in a system of multiple quantum dots capable of producing the highly entangled fermionic states necessary to reach the regime, where these additional constraints become dominant and can be probed. The type and strength of the required multi-fermion entanglement provides barriers to reaching deep into this regime. Transcending these barriers thus serves as a testing ground for the capabilities of future fermionic quantum information processing as well as quantum computer architectures based on fermionic states.},

We apply this framework to the free Dirac field in four dimensions where we compute the circuit complexity of the Dirac ground state with respect to several classes of spatially unentangled reference states. Moreover, we show that our methods can also be applied to compute the complexity of excited energy eigenstates of the free Dirac field.

For the purpose of (A) real time evolution, (B) excitation spectra, (C) spectral functions and (D) imaginary time evolution, we show how the geometric approach highlights the necessity to distinguish between two classes of manifolds: K{\"a}hler and non-K{\"a}hler. Traditional variational methods typically require the variational family to be a K{\"a}hler manifold, where multiplication by the imaginary unit preserves the tangent spaces. This covers the vast majority of cases studied in the literature. However, recently proposed classes of generalized Gaussian states make it necessary to also include the non-K{\"a}hler case, which has already been encountered occasionally. We illustrate our approach in detail with a range of concrete examples where the geometric structures of the considered manifolds are particularly relevant. These go from Gaussian states and group theoretic coherent states to generalized Gaussian states.}

  abstract = {In this work we investigate a model of thermalization wherein a single ancillary qubit randomly interacts with the system to be thermalized. This not only sheds light on the emergence of Gibbs states in nature, but also provides a routine for preparing arbitrary thermal states on a digital quantum computer. For desired \${\textbackslash}beta\$ and random interaction \$G\$ the routine boils down to time independent Hamiltonian simulation and is represented by the channel \${\textbackslash}Phi : {\textbackslash}rho {\textbackslash}mapsto {\textbackslash}mathbb\{E\}\_G \{{\textbackslash}rm Tr\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Env\} {\textbackslash}left[ e{\textasciicircum}\{-i(H + {\textbackslash}alpha G)t\} {\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}rho {\textbackslash}otimes {\textbackslash}frac\{e{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}beta H\_E\}\}\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{Z\}\}{\textbackslash}right) e{\textasciicircum}\{i (H + {\textbackslash}alpha G)t\} {\textbackslash}right]\$. We rigorously prove that these dynamics reduce to a Markov chain process in the weak-coupling regime with the thermal state as the approximate fixed point. We upper bound the total simulation time required in terms of the Markov chain spectral gap \${\textbackslash}lambda\_{\textbackslash}star\$, which we compute exactly in the ground state limit. These results are independent of any eigenvalue knowledge of the system, but we are further able to show that with knowledge of eigenvalue differences \${\textbackslash}lambda\_S(i) - {\textbackslash}lambda\_S(j)\$, then the total simulation time is dramatically reduced. The ratio of the complete ignorance simulation cost to the perfect knowledge simulation cost scales as \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\} {\textbackslash}left(\{{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\{H\_S\}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}7\}\{{\textbackslash}delta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm min\}{\textasciicircum}7 {\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{3.5\} {\textbackslash}lambda\_{\textbackslash}star({\textbackslash}beta){\textasciicircum}\{3.5\}\}\}{\textbackslash}right)\$, where \${\textbackslash}delta\_\{{\textbackslash}min\}\$ is related to the eigenvalue differences of the system. Additionally, we provide more specific results for single qubit and harmonic oscillator systems as well as numeric experiments with hydrogen chains. In addition to the algorithmic merits, these results can be viewed as broad extensions of the Repeated Interactions model to generic Hamiltonians with unknown interactions, giving a complete picture of the thermalization process for quantum systems.},

They are promising tools to benchmark quantum devices and measure free energy differences. While they are well established theoretically and also experimental realizations for few-body systems already exist, their experimental validity in the quantum many-body regime has not been observed so far. Here, we present results for nonequilibrium protocols in systems with up to sixteen interacting degrees of freedom obtained on trapped ion and superconducting qubit quantum computers, which test the quantum Jarzynski equality and the Crooks relation in the many-body regime. To achieve this, we overcome present-day limitations in the preparation of thermal ensembles and in the measurement of work distributions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We discuss the accuracy to which the Jarzynski equality holds on different quantum computing platforms subject to platform-specific errors. The analysis reveals the validity of Jarzynski's equality in a regime with energy dissipation, compensated for by a fast unitary drive. This provides new insights for analyzing errors in many-body quantum simulators.},

  abstract = {Consider the question: what statistical ensemble corresponds to minimal prior knowledge about a quantum system ? For the case where the system is in fact known to be in a pure state there is an obvious answer, corresponding to the unique unitarily-invariant measure on the Hilbert sphere. However, the problem is open for the general case where states are described by density operators. Here two approaches to the problem are investigated. The first approach assumes that the system is randomly correlated with a second system, where the ensemble of composite systems is described by a random pure state. Results for qubits randomly correlated with other systems are presented, including average entanglement entropies. It is shown that maximum correlation is guaranteed in the limit as one system becomes infinite-dimensional. The second approach relies on choosing a metric on the space of density operators, and generating a corresponding ensemble from the induced volume element. Comparisons between the approaches are made for qubits, for which the second approach (based on the Bures metric) yields the most symmetric, and hence the least informative, ensemble of density operators.},

A small system thermalizes to this ensemble while exchanging heat and particles with a bath. A quantum system may exchange quantities represented by operators that fail to commute. Whether such a system thermalizes and what form the thermal state has are questions about truly quantum thermodynamics. Here we investigate this thermal state from three perspectives. First, we introduce an approximate microcanonical ensemble. If this ensemble characterizes the system-and-bath composite, tracing out the bath yields the system's thermal state. This state is expected to be the equilibrium point, we argue, of typical dynamics. Finally, we define a resource-theory model for thermodynamic exchanges of noncommuting observables. Complete passivity---the inability to extract work from equilibrium states---implies the thermal state's form, too. Our work opens new avenues into equilibrium in the presence of quantum noncommutation.},

  abstract = {Noncommuting conserved quantities have recently launched a subfield of quantum thermodynamics. In conventional thermodynamics, a system of interest and an environment exchange quantities -- energy, particles, electric charge, etc. -- that are globally conserved and are represented by Hermitian operators. These operators were implicitly assumed to commute with each other, until a few years ago. Freeing the operators to fail to commute has enabled many theoretical discoveries -- about reference frames, entropy production, resource-theory models, etc. Little work has bridged these results from abstract theory to experimental reality. This paper provides a methodology for building this bridge systematically: We present a prescription for constructing Hamiltonians that conserve noncommuting quantities globally while transporting the quantities locally. The Hamiltonians can couple arbitrarily many subsystems together and can be integrable or nonintegrable. Our Hamiltonians may be realized physically with superconducting qudits, with ultracold atoms, and with trapped ions.},

Our results show the advantages of utilising coherence as a resource in the operation of the machine, and allows it: (i) to exhibit unconventional behaviour such as the appearance of a hybrid refrigerator, capable of simultaneous refrigeration and generation of work, and (ii) to function as an engine or a refrigerator with efficiencies larger than the Carnot bound.

  abstract = {The computational power of symmetry-protected phases of matter can be accessed through local measurements, but what is the most efficient way of doing so? In this work, we show that minimizing operational resources in measurement-based quantum computation on subsystem symmetric resource states amounts to solving a sub-Riemannian geodesic problem between the identity and the target logical unitary. This reveals a geometric structure underlying MBQC and offers a principled route to optimize quantum processing in computational phases.},

  abstract = {Although extraction of energy from the ground state is forbidden, one can utilize Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) protocol for energy extraction -- a two-step protocol involving quantum measurements followed by LOCC. This is an unique method to ``extract energy from ground states'' of quantum systems. QET requires some correlation in the ground state, and entanglement correlation plays a crucial roles as a resource. The general belief is that if the ground state is quantum-correlated via entanglement for two different sites in a quantum system, and if we perform measurements on one of the sites, we can find an LOCC for the other site to successfully accomplish QET. In this paper, we show that this belief may not be true in the case of the Toric Code. We demonstrate this by performing a PVM measurements on spins in the Toric Code. Based on the measurement outcomes, we found that there is no LOCC for successful QET.},

In this paper we propose that the experiences of any observer \$Ob\$ in a closed universe can be approximately described by a quantum mechanical theory with a Hilbert space whose dimension is roughly \$e{\textasciicircum}\{S\_\{Ob\}\}\$, where \$S\_\{Ob\}\$ is the number of degrees of freedom of \$Ob\$. Moreover we argue that the errors in this description are exponentially small in \$S\_\{Ob\}\$. We give evidence for this proposal using the gravitational path integral and the coding interpretation of holography, and we explain how similar effects arise in black hole physics in appropriate circumstances.},

From quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and quantum gravity, dualities have proven useful in solving problems that are otherwise quite intractable. Being surprising and unexpected, dualities have been taken to raise philosophical questions about the nature and formulation of scientific theories, scientific realism, emergence, symmetries, explanation, understanding, and theory construction. This book discusses what dualities are, gives a selection of examples, explores the themes and roles that make dualities interesting, and highlights their most salient types. It aims to be an entry point into discussions of dualities in both physics and philosophy. The philosophical discussion emphasises three main topics: whether duals are theoretically equivalent, the view of scientific theories that is suggested by dualities (namely, a geometric view of theories), and the compatibility between duality and emergence.},

These interactions are often viewed as detrimental, as they dissipate energy and decohere quantum states. Nonetheless, when controlled, dissipation is an essential tool for manipulating quantum information: Dissipation engineering enables quantum measurement, quantum state preparation, and quantum state stabilization. The progress of quantum device technology, marked by improvements of characteristic coherence times and extensible architectures for quantum control, has coincided with the development of such dissipation engineering tools which interface quantum and classical degrees of freedom. This Review presents dissipation as a fundamental aspect of the measurement and control of quantum devices and highlights the role of dissipation engineering for quantum error correction and quantum simulation that enables quantum information processing on a practical scale.},

  abstract = {Quantum information processing at scale will require sufficiently stable and long-lived qubits, likely enabled by error-correction codes. Several recent superconducting-qubit experiments, however, reported observing intermittent spatiotemporally correlated errors that would be problematic for conventional codes, with ionizing radiation being a likely cause. Here, we directly measured the cosmic-ray contribution to spatiotemporally correlated qubit errors. We accomplished this by synchronously monitoring cosmic-ray detectors and qubit energy-relaxation dynamics of 10 transmon qubits distributed across a 5x5x0.35 mm\${\textasciicircum}3\$ silicon chip. Cosmic rays caused correlated errors at a rate of 1/(10 min), accounting for 17\${\textbackslash}pm\$1\% of all such events. Our qubits responded to essentially all of the cosmic rays and their secondary particles incident on the chip, consistent with the independently measured arrival flux. Moreover, we observed that the landscape of the superconducting gap in proximity to the Josephson junctions dramatically impacts the qubit response to cosmic rays. Given the practical difficulties associated with shielding cosmic rays, our results indicate the importance of radiation hardening -- for example, superconducting gap engineering -- to the realization of robust quantum error correction.},

  abstract = {Symmetries impose structure on the Hilbert space of a quantum mechanical model. The mathematical units of this structure are the irreducible representations of symmetry groups and I consider how they function as conceptual units of interpretation. For models with symmetry, the properties of irreducible representations constrain the possibilities of Hilbert space arithmetic, i.e.{\textbackslash} how a Hilbert space can be decomposed into sums of subspaces and factored into products of subspaces. Partitioning the Hilbert space is equivalent to parsing the system into subsystems, and these emergent subsystems provide insight into the kinematics, dynamics, and informatics of a quantum model. This article provides examples of how complex models can be built up from irreducible representations that correspond to `natural' ontological units like spins and particles. It also gives examples of the reverse process in which complex models are partitioned into subsystems that are selected by the representations of the symmetries and require no underlying ontological commitments. These techniques are applied to a few-body model in one-dimension with a Hamiltonian depending on an interaction strength parameter. As this parameter is tuned, the Hamiltonian runs dynamical spectrum from integrable to chaotic, and the subsystems relevant for analyzing and interpreting the dynamics shift accordingly.},

The key elements in these tradeoff relations are the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and speed limit, which are closely related to information inequalities from which other tradeoff relations are derived. Concentration inequalities are relations that complement information inequalities in statistical analyses and have been widely used in various fields. However, their role in thermodynamic tradeoff relations remains unclear. This study develops thermodynamic concentration inequalities that provide bounds for the distribution of observables in quantum and classical Markov processes. We derive a set of tradeoff relations that generalise speed limits and thermodynamic uncertainty relations from the developed thermodynamic concentration inequalities. The derived tradeoff relations hold under minimal assumptions of the underlying physical processes. This study clarifies the role of concentration inequalities in thermodynamics, paving the way for deriving new tradeoff relations.},

Breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, quantum simulations, and quantum error correction are bringing useful quantum computation closer to fruition.

QCVV methods and protocols enable scientists and engineers to scrutinize, understand, and enhance the performance of quantum information-processing devices. In this tutorial, we review the fundamental principles underpinning QCVV, and introduce a diverse array of QCVV tools used by quantum researchers. We define and explain QCVV's core models and concepts---quantum states, measurements, and processes---and illustrate how these building blocks are leveraged to examine a target system or operation. We survey and introduce protocols ranging from simple qubit characterization to advanced benchmarking methods. Along the way, we provide illustrated examples and detailed descriptions of the protocols, highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each, and discuss their potential scalability to future large-scale quantum computers. This tutorial serves as a guidebook for researchers unfamiliar with the benchmarking and characterization of quantum computers, and also as a detailed reference for experienced practitioners.},

As time increase, black holes may merge together but can never bifurcate. A black hole would be expected to settle down to a stationary state. It is shown that a stationary black hole must have topologically spherical boundary and must be axisymmetric if it is rotating. These results together with those of Israel and Carter go most of the way towards establishing the conjecture that any stationary black hole is a Kerr solution. Using this conjecture and the result that the surface area of black holes can never decrease, one can place certain limits on the amount of energy that can be extracted from black holes.},

However it is shown that quantum mechanical effects cause black holes to create and emit particles as if they were hot bodies with temperature(Formula presented.) where {$\kappa$} is the surface gravity of the black hole. This thermal emission leads to a slow decrease in the mass of the black hole and to its eventual disappearance: any primordial black hole of mass less than about 1015 g would have evaporated by now. Although these quantum effects violate the classical law that the area of the event horizon of a black hole cannot decrease, there remains a Generalized Second Law: S+1/4 A never decreases where S is the entropy of matter outside black holes and A is the sum of the surface areas of the event horizons. This shows that gravitational collapse converts the baryons and leptons in the collapsing body into entropy.

If the evaporation of the black hole has already proceeded past the "half-way" point, where half of the initial entropy has been radiated away, then additional quantum information deposited in the black hole is revealed in the Hawking radiation very rapidly. Information deposited prior to the half-way point remains concealed until the half-way point, and then emerges quickly. These conclusions hold because typical local quantum circuits are efficient encoders for quantum error-correcting codes that nearly achieve the capacity of the quantum erasure channel. Our estimate of a black hole's information retention time, based on speculative dynamical assumptions, is just barely compatible with the black hole complementarity hypothesis.},

  abstract = {One of the most important properties of quantum information, and the one ultimately responsible for its cryptographic applications, is that it can't be copied. That statement, however, is not completely accurate. While the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics prevents quantum information from being copied in space, the reversibility of microscopic physics actually requires that the information be copied in time. In spacetime as a whole, therefore, quantum information is widely replicated but in a restricted fashion. We fully characterize which regions of spacetime can all hold the same quantum information. Because quantum information can be delocalized through quantum error correction and teleportation, it need not follow well-defined trajectories. Instead, replication of the information in any configuration of spacetime regions not leading to violations of causality or the no-cloning principle is allowed. To demonstrate this, we answer the operational question of exactly when the information can be summoned to a set of spacetime points, showing how to do so efficiently using a combination of teleportation and codeword-stabilized quantum codes. This provides a simple and complete description of where and when a qubit can be located in spacetime, revealing a remarkable variety of possibilities.},

  abstract = {We establish that, in an appropriate limit, qubits of communication should be regarded as composite resources, decomposing cleanly into independent correlation and transmission components. Because qubits of communication can establish ebits of entanglement, qubits are more powerful resources than ebits. We identify a new communications resource, the zero-bit, which is precisely half the gap between them, replacing classical bits by zero-bits makes teleportation asymptotically reversible. The decomposition of a qubit into an ebit and two zero-bits has wide-ranging consequences including applications to state merging, the quantum channel capacity, entanglement distillation, quantum identification and remote state preparation. The source of these results is the theory of approximate quantum error correction. The action of a quantum channel is reversible if and only if no information is leaked to the environment, a characterization that is useful even in approximate form. However, different notions of approximation lead to qualitatively different forms of quantum error correction in the limit of large dimension. We study the effect of a constraint on the dimension of the reference system when considering information leakage. While the resulting condition fails to ensure that the entire input can be corrected, it does ensure that all subspaces of dimension matching that of the reference are correctable. The size of the reference can be characterized by a parameter \${\textbackslash}alpha\$, we call the associated resource an \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-bit. Changing \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ interpolates between standard quantum error correction and quantum identification, a form of equality testing for quantum states. We develop the theory of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-bits, including the applications above, and determine the \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-bit capacity of general quantum channels, finding single-letter formulas for the entanglement-assisted and amortised variants.},

  abstract = {The existence of quantum error correcting codes is one of the most counterintuitive and potentially technologically important discoveries of quantum information theory. However, standard error correction refers to abstract quantum information, i.e., information that is independent of the physical incarnation of the systems used for storing the information. There are, however, other forms of information that are physical - one of the most ubiquitous being reference frame information. Here we analyze the problem of error correcting physical information. The basic question we seek to answer is whether or not such error correction is possible and, if so, what limitations govern the process. The main challenge is that the systems used for transmitting physical information, in addition to any actions applied to them, must necessarily obey these limitations. Encoding and decoding operations that obey a restrictive set of limitations need not exist a priori. We focus on the case of erasure errors, and we first show that the problem is equivalent to quantum error correction using group-covariant encodings. We prove a no-go theorem showing that that no finite dimensional, group-covariant quantum codes exist for Lie groups with an infinitesimal generator (e.g., U(1), SU(2), and SO(3)). We then explain how one can circumvent this no-go theorem using infinite dimensional codes, and we give an explicit example of a covariant quantum error correcting code using continuous variables for the group U(1). Finally, we demonstrate that all finite groups have finite dimensional codes, giving both an explicit construction and a randomized approximate construction with exponentially better parameters.},

The master equation is divided into a unitary piece, represented by an effective Hamiltonian, and a dissipative piece, represented by a hermiticity-preserving superoperator; however, the division of open system dynamics into unitary and dissipative pieces is non-unique. For finite-dimensional quantum systems, we resolve this non-uniqueness by specifying a norm on the space of dissipative superoperators and defining the canonical Hamiltonian to be the one whose dissipator is minimal. We show that the canonical Hamiltonian thus defined is equivalent to the Hamiltonian initially defined by Lindblad, and that it is uniquely specified by requiring the dissipator's jump operators to be traceless, extending a uniqueness result known previously in the special case of Markovian master equations. For a system weakly coupled to its environment, we give a recursive formula for computing the canonical effective Hamiltonian to arbitrary orders in perturbation theory, which we can think of as a perturbative scheme for renormalizing the system's bare Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {A generally relativistic theory of thermodynamics is developed, based on four main physical principles: heat is a local form of energy, therefore described by a thermal energy tensor; conservation of mass, equivalent to conservation of heat, or the local first law; entropy is a local current; and non-destruction of entropy, or the local second law. A fluid is defined by the thermostatic energy tensor being isotropic. The entropy current is related to the other fields by certain equations, including a generalised Gibbs equation for the thermostatic entropy, followed by linear and quadratic terms in the dissipative (thermal minus thermostatic) energy tensor. Then the second law suggests certain equations for the dissipative energy tensor, generalising the Israel- Stewart dissipative relations, which describe heat conduction and viscosity including relativistic effects and relaxation effects. In the thermostatic case, the perfect-fluid model is recovered. In the linear approximation for entropy, the Eckart theory is recovered. In the quadratic approximation for entropy, the theory is similar to that of Israel \& Stewart, but involving neither state-space differentials, nor a non-equilibrium Gibbs equation, nor non-material frames. Also, unlike conventional thermodynamics, the thermal energy density is not assumed to be purely thermostatic, though this is derived in the linear approximation. Otherwise, the theory reduces in the non- relativistic limit to the extended thermodynamics of irreversible processes due to Mueller. The dissipative energy density seems to be a new thermodynamical field, but also exists in relativistic kinetic theory of gases.},

Secondly, any platform hosting such an experiment in space generally provides an environment close to room temperature for the accommodated equipment. To obtain cryogenic temperatures without active cooling, one must isolate the instrument from radiative and conductive heat exchange with the platform as well as possible. We investigate the limits of this passive cooling method in the context of a recently proposed experiment to observe the decoherence of quantum superpositions of massive objects. The analyses and conclusions are applicable to a host of similar experimental designs requiring a cryogenic environment in space.},

This builds on experience obtained in supersymmetric field theories that can be applied successfully to generic quantum field theory integrals. It involves studying leading singularities and explicit integral representations. When the differential equations are cast into canonical form, their solution becomes elementary. The class of functions involved is easily identified, and the solution can be written down to any desired order in epsilon within dimensional regularization. Results obtained in this way are particularly simple and compact. In this letter, we outline the general ideas of the method and apply them to a two-loop example.},

  abstract = {This thesis is focused on the development of new mathematical methods for computing multi-loop scattering amplitudes in gauge theories. In this work we combine, for the first time, the unitarity-based construction for integrands, and the recently introduced integrand-reduction through multivariate polynomial division. After discussing the generic features of this novel reduction algorithm, we will apply it to the one- and two-loop five-point amplitudes in \$\{{\textbackslash}backslashcal N\}=4\$ sYM. The integrands of the multiple-cuts are generated from products of tree-level amplitudes within the super-amplitudes formalism. The corresponding expressions will be used for the analytic reconstruction of the polynomial residues. Their parametric form is known a priori, as derived by means of successive polynomial divisions using the Gr\${\textbackslash}backslash\$"obner basis associated to the on-shell denominators. The integrand reduction method will be exploited to investigate the color-kinematic duality for multi-loop \$\{{\textbackslash}backslashcal N\}=4\$ sYM scattering amplitudes. Our analysis yields a suggestive, systematic way to generate graphs which automatically satisfy the color-kinematic dualities. Finally, we will extract the leading ultra-violet divergences of five-point one- and two-loop amplitudes in \$\{{\textbackslash}backslashcal N\}=4\$ sYM, which represent a paradigmatic example for studying the UV behavior of supersymmetric amplitudes.},

Unlike in gauge theory where the analogous form involves only \${\textbackslash}backslashdlog\$-factors, in gravity there is a non-trivial numerator as well as higher degree poles in the edge variables. Based on the structure of the Grassmannian formula for \${\textbackslash}backslashN=8\$ supergravity we conjecture that gravity loop amplitudes also possess similar properties. In particular, we find that there are only logarithmic singularities on cuts with finite loop momentum, poles at infinity are present and loop amplitudes show special behavior on certain collinear cuts. We demonstrate on 1-loop and 2-loop examples that the behavior on collinear cuts is a highly non-trivial property which requires cancellations between all terms contributing to the amplitude.},

In equilibrium, quantum ferrofluids formed from ultracold atoms were recently shown to spontaneously develop coherent density patterns, manifesting a supersolid. We theoretically investigate the phase diagram of such quantum ferrofluids in oblate trap geometries and find an even wider range of exotic states of matter. Two-dimensional supersolid crystals formed from individual ferrofluid quantum droplets dominate the phase diagram at low densities. For higher densities we find honeycomb and labyrinthine states, as well as a pumpkin phase. We discuss scaling relations which allow us to find these phases for a wide variety of trap geometries, interaction strengths, and atom numbers. Our study illuminates the origin of the various possible patterns of quantum ferrofluids and shows that their occurrence is generic of strongly dipolar interacting systems stabilized by beyond mean-field effects.},

The leading term is proportional to the area of the dividing boundary; we also extract finite subleading contributions for a field defined in the bulk interior of a waveguide in 3+1 dimensions, including terms proportional to the waveguide's cross-sectional geometry: its area, perimeter length, and integrated curvature.

The correction has a universal form for any conformal field theory that depends only on the size of the mass gap, its degeneracy, and the angular size of the cap. We confirm our result by calculating the entanglement entropy of a conformally coupled scalar numerically. We argue that an apparent discrepancy for the scalar can be explained away through a careful treatment of boundary terms. In an appendix, to confirm the accuracy of the numerics, we study the mutual information of two cap-like regions at zero temperature.},

This implies non-trivial identities for non-planar diagrams as well as interesting relations between the N = 4 and N = 8 theories. We show that the on-shell diagrams of N = 8 supergravity obey equivalence relations analogous to those of N = 4 super-Yang-Mills, and we develop a systematic algorithm for reading off Grassmannian integral formulae directly from the on-shell diagrams.

  abstract = {Quantum theory provides an extensive framework for the description of the equilibrium properties of quantum matter. Yet experiments in quantum simulators have now opened up a route towards generating quantum states beyond this equilibrium paradigm. While these states promise to show properties not constrained by equilibrium principles such as the equal a priori probability of the microcanonical ensemble, identifying general properties of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a major challenge especially in view of the lack of conventional concepts such as free energies. The theory of dynamical quantum phase transitions attempts to identify such general principles by lifting the concept of phase transitions to coherent quantum real-time evolution. This review provides a pedagogical introduction to this field. Starting from the general setting of nonequilibrium dynamics in closed quantum many-body systems, we give the definition of dynamical quantum phase transitions as phase transitions in time with physical quantities becoming nonanalytic at critical times. We summarize the achieved theoretical advances as well as the first experimental observations, and furthermore provide an outlook onto major open questions as well as future directions of research.},

Using the Ward--Takahashi identity and the effective action formalism, we establish the Nambu--Goldstone theorem in open systems, and derive the low-energy coefficients that determine the dispersion relation of Nambu--Goldstone modes. Using these coefficients, we classify the Nambu--Goldstone modes into four types: type-A propagation, type-A diffusion, type-B propagation, and type-B diffusion modes.}

By now it should be possible to obtain consensus on at least one issue: Are the fundamental constituents fields or particles? As this paper shows, experiment and theory imply unbounded fields, not bounded particles, are fundamental. This is especially clear for relativistic systems, implying it's also true of non-relativistic systems. Particles are epiphenomena arising from fields. Thus the Schroedinger field is a space-filling physical field whose value at any spatial point is the probability amplitude for an interaction to occur at that point. The field for an electron is the electron; each electron extends over both slits in the 2-slit experiment and spreads over the entire pattern; and quantum physics is about interactions of microscopic systems with the macroscopic world rather than just about measurements. It's important to clarify this issue because textbooks still teach a particles- and measurement-oriented interpretation that contributes to bewilderment among students and pseudoscience among the public. This article reviews classical and quantum fields, the 2-slit experiment, rigorous theorems showing particles are inconsistent with relativistic quantum theory, and several phenomena showing particles are incompatible with quantum field theories.},

  abstract = {It was recently noted that different internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) partition a system in different ways into subsystems, much like different inertial observers in special relativity decompose spacetime in different ways into space and time. Here we expand on this QRF relativity of subsystems and elucidate that it is the source of all novel QRF dependent effects, just like the relativity of simultaneity is the origin of all characteristic special relativistic phenomena. We show that subsystem relativity, in fact, also arises in special relativity with internal frames and, by implying the relativity of simultaneity, constitutes a generalisation of it. Physical consequences of the QRF relativity of subsystems, which we explore here systematically, and the relativity of simultaneity may thus be seen in similar light. We focus on investigating when and how subsystem correlations and entropies, interactions and types of dynamics (open vs. closed), as well as quantum thermodynamical processes change under QRF transformations. We show that thermal equilibrium is generically QRF relative and find that, remarkably, QRF transformations not only can change a subsystem temperature, but even map positive into negative temperature states. We further examine how non-equilibrium notions of heat and work exchange, as well as entropy production and flow depend on the QRF. Along the way, we develop the first study of how reduced subsystem states transform under QRF changes. Focusing on physical insights, we restrict to ideal QRFs associated with finite abelian groups. Besides being conducive to rigour, the ensuing finite-dimensional setting is where quantum information-theoretic quantities and quantum thermodynamics are best developed. We anticipate, however, that our results extend qualitatively to more general groups and frames, and even to subsystems in gauge theory and gravity. [abridged]},

The renormalization group is then developed in some detail, and applied to a variety of systems. The main dynamic universality classes are identified and characterized.

  abstract = {We give a mathematical formulation for the Choi-Jamiolkowski (CJ) correspondence in the infinite-dimensional case in the form close to one used in quantum information theory. We show that there is no need to use a limiting procedure to define "unnormalized maximally entangled state" and the corresponding analog of the Choi matrix since they can be defined rigorously as, in general, nonclosable forms on an appropriate dense subspace. The properties of these forms are discussed in Sec. 2. An important question is: when the CJ form is given by a bounded operator. This is the case for entanglement-breaking channels: we prove this in Sec. 3 along with a version of a result of Wolf et al. characterizing CJ operators which correspond to such channels by giving precise definitions of a separable operator and a relevant integral. In Sec. 4 we obtain explicit expressions for CJ forms and operators defining a general Bosonic Gaussian channel. In Sec. 5 we give a decomposition of the Gaussian CJ form into product of the four principal types and a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of the bounded CJ operator.},

  abstract = {The usual formulations of quantum field theory in Minkowski spacetime make crucial use of features-such as Poincar{\'e} invariance and the existence of a preferred vacuum state-that are very special to Minkowski spacetime. In order to generalize the formulation of quantum field theory to arbitrary globally hyperbolic curved spacetimes, it is essential that the theory be formulated in an entirely local and covariant manner, without assuming the presence of a preferred state. We propose a new framework for quantum field theory, in which the existence of an Operator Product Expansion (OPE) is elevated to a fundamental status, and, in essence, all of the properties of the quantum field theory are determined by its OPE. We provide general axioms for the OPE coefficients of a quantum field theory. These include a local and covariance assumption (implying that the quantum field theory is constructed in a local and covariant manner from the spacetime metric and other background structure, such as time and space orientations), a microlocal spectrum condition, an "associativity" condition, and the requirement that the coefficient of the identity in the OPE of the product of a field with its adjoint have positive scaling degree. We prove curved spacetime versions of the spin-statistics theorem and the PCT theorem. Some potentially significant further implications of our new viewpoint on quantum field theory are discussed. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag 2009.}

Our review emphasizes the conceptual issues arising in the formulation of the theory and presents known results in a mathematically precise way. Particular attention is paid to the distributional nature of quantum fields, to their local and covariant character, and to microlocal spectrum conditions satisfied by physically reasonable states. We review the Unruh and Hawking effects for free fields, as well as the behavior of free fields in deSitter spacetime and FLRW spacetimes with an exponential phase of expansion. We review how nonlinear observables of a free field, such as the stress-energy tensor, are defined, as well as time-ordered-products. The "renormalization ambiguities" involved in the definition of time-ordered products are fully characterized. Interacting fields are then perturbatively constructed. Our main focus is on the theory of a scalar field, but a brief discussion of gauge fields is included. We conclude with a brief discussion of a possible approach towards a nonperturbative formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime and some remarks on the formulation of quantum gravity.}

  abstract = {We present a proof that the quantum Yang-Mills theory can be consistently defined as a renormalized, perturbative quantum field theory on an arbitrary globally hyperbolic curved, Lorentzian spacetime. To this end, we construct the non-commutative algebra of observables, in the sense of formal power series, as well as a space of corresponding quantum states. The algebra contains all gauge invariant, renormalized, interacting quantum field operators (polynomials in the field strength and its derivatives), and all their relations such as commutation relations or operator product expansion. It can be viewed as a deformation quantization of the Poisson algebra of classical Yang-Mills theory equipped with the Peierls bracket. The algebra is constructed as the cohomology of an auxiliary algebra describing a gauge fixed theory with ghosts and anti-fields. A key technical difficulty is to establish a suitable hierarchy of Ward identities at the renormalized level that ensures conservation of the interacting BRST-current, and that the interacting BRST-charge is nilpotent. The algebra of physical interacting field observables is obtained as the cohomology of this charge. As a consequence of our constructions, we can prove that the operator product expansion closes on the space of gauge invariant operators. Similarly, the renormalization group flow is proved not to leave the space of gauge invariant operators. The key technical tool behind these arguments is a new universal Ward identity that is formulated at the algebraic level, and that is proven to be consistent with a local and covariant renormalization prescription. We also develop a new technique to accomplish this renormalization process, and in particular give a new expression for some of the renormalization constants in terms of cycles. {\copyright} 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

  abstract = {Passive error correction protects logical information forever (in the thermodynamic limit) by updating the system based only on local information and few-body interactions. A paradigmatic example is the classical two-dimensional Ising model: a Metropolis-style Gibbs sampler retains the sign of the initial magnetization (a logical bit) for thermodynamically long times in the low-temperature phase. Known models of passive quantum error correction similarly exhibit thermodynamic phase transitions to a low-temperature phase wherein logical qubits are protected by thermally stable topological order. Here, in contrast, we show that certain families of constant-rate classical and quantum low-density parity check codes have no thermodynamic phase transitions at nonzero temperature, but nonetheless exhibit ergodicity-breaking dynamical transitions: below a critical nonzero temperature, the mixing time of local Gibbs sampling diverges in the thermodynamic limit. Slow Gibbs sampling of such codes enables fault-tolerant passive quantum error correction using finite-depth circuits. This strategy is well suited to measurement-free quantum error correction and may present a desirable experimental alternative to conventional quantum error correction based on syndrome measurements and active feedback.},

But the essence of quantum formalism-entanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, and Schr{\"o}dinger-waited over 70 years to enter laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, has potential for many quantum processes, including canonical ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and dense coding. However, it appears that this new resource is complex and difficult to detect. Although it is usually fragile to the environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation, and quantification. In particular, various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, and quantum cryptography are discussed, and some interrelations are pointed out. The basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within a distant laboratory paradigm is stressed, and some peculiarities such as the irreversibility of entanglement manipulations are also discussed including its extremal form-the bound entanglement phenomenon. The basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized. {\copyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.}

To propel this new generation of experiments, we are confronted with the need to model nonunitary many-body dynamics in strongly coupled regimes by transcending traditional approaches in quantum optics. In this work, we contribute to this program by adapting a functional-integral technique, conventionally employed in high-energy physics, in order to obtain nonequilibrium dynamics for interacting light-matter systems. Our approach is grounded in constructing ``two-particle irreducible'' (2PI) effective actions, which provide a nonperturbative and conserving framework for describing quantum evolution at a polynomial cost in time. We apply our method to complement the analysis of spin-glass formation in the context of frustrated multimode cavity quantum electrodynamics, initiated in our accompanying work [Hosseinabadi , Phys.

The method is based on a gedanken experiment on quantum energy teleportation (QET), which has been recently proposed in quantum information theory. We consider this QET protocol for N massless fields in near-horizon regions of large-mass black holes with near-horizon geometry described by the Minkowski metric. For each field, a two-level spin is strongly coupled with the local quantum fluctuation outside the horizon during a short time period. After the measurement of N fields, N-bit information is obtained. During the measurement, positive-energy wave packets of the fields form and then fall into the black hole. The amount of excitation energy is independent of the measurement result. After absorption of the wave packets and increase of the black hole mass, a measurement-result-dependent local operation of the N fields is performed outside the horizon. Then, accompanying the extraction of positive energy from the quantum fluctuation by the operation, negative-energy wave packets of the fields form and then fall into the black hole, decreasing the black hole mass. This implies that a part of the absorbed positive energy emitted from the measurement devices is effectively retrieved from the black hole via the measurement results.},

Consequently, wavepackects generated by A' measurement propagate the vacuum to spatial infinity. Let us assume that Bob stays away from Alice and fails to catch the excitation energy when the wavepackets pass in front of him. Next Alice announces her local measurement result to Bob by classical communication. Bob performs a local unitary operation depending on the measurement result. In this process, positive energy is released from the fields to Bob's apparatus of the unitary operation. In the field systems, wavepackets are generated with negative energy around Bob's location.

  abstract = {Critical metrology relies on the precise preparation of a system in its ground state near a quantum phase transition point where quantum correlations get very strong. Typically this increases the quantum Fisher information with respect to changes in system parameters and thus improves the optimally possible measurement precision limited by the Cram{\textbackslash}'er-Rao bound. Hence critical metrology involves encoding information about the unknown parameter in changes of the system's ground state. Conversely, in conventional metrology methods like Ramsey interferometry, the eigenstates of the system remain unchanged, and information about the unknown parameter is encoded in the relative phases that excited system states accumulate during their time evolution. Here we introduce an approach combining these two methodologies into a unified protocol applicable to closed and driven-dissipative systems. We show that the quantum Fisher information in this case exhibits an additional interference term originating from the interplay between eigenstate and relative phase changes. We provide analytical expressions for the quantum and classical Fisher information in such a setup, elucidating as well a straightforward measurement approach that nearly attains the maximum precision permissible under the Cram{\textbackslash}'er-Rao bound. We showcase these results by focusing on the squeezing Hamiltonian, which characterizes the thermodynamic limit of Dicke and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Hamiltonians.},

Aiming to reveal the ultimate source of these problems, we demand of work measurement schemes the sheer minimum and see if those demands can be met at all. We require (\${\textbackslash}backslashmathfrak\{A\}\$) energy conservation for arbitrary initial states of the system and (\${\textbackslash}backslashmathfrak\{B\}\$) the Jarzynski equality for thermal initial states. By energy conservation we mean that the average work must be equal to the difference of initial and final average energies, and that untouched systems must exchange deterministically zero work. Requirement \${\textbackslash}backslashmathfrak\{B\}\$ encapsulates the second law of thermodynamics and the quantum--classical correspondence principle. We prove that work measurement schemes that do not depend on the system's initial state satisfy \${\textbackslash}backslashmathfrak\{B\}\$ if and only if they coincide with the famous two-point measurement scheme, thereby establishing that state-independent schemes cannot simultaneously satisfy \${\textbackslash}backslashmathfrak\{A\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}backslashmathfrak\{B\}\$. Expanding to the realm of state-dependent schemes allows for more compatibility between \${\textbackslash}backslashmathfrak\{A\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}backslashmathfrak\{B\}\$.

  abstract = {Quantum computers promise dramatic advantages over their classical counterparts, but the answer to the most basic question "What is the source of the power in quantum computing?" has remained elusive. Here we prove a remarkable equivalence between the onset of contextuality and the possibility of universal quantum computation via magic state distillation. This is a conceptually satisfying link because contextuality provides one of the fundamental characterizations of uniquely quantum phenomena and, moreover, magic state distillation is the leading model for experimentally realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Furthermore, this connection suggests a unifying paradigm for the resources of quantum information: the nonlocality of quantum theory is a particular kind of contextuality and nonlocality is already known to be a critical resource for achieving advantages with quantum communication. In addition to clarifying these fundamental issues, this work advances the resource framework for quantum computation, which has a number of practical applications, such as characterizing the efficiency and trade-offs between distinct theoretical and experimental schemes for achieving robust quantum computation and bounding the overhead cost for the classical simulation of quantum algorithms.},

  abstract = {Transmitting energy and information are two essential aspects of nature. Recent findings suggest they are closely related, while a quantitative equivalence between them is still unknown. This thus motivates us to ask: Can information transmission tasks equal certain energy transmission tasks? We answer this question positively by bounding various one-shot classical capacities via different energy transmission tasks. Such bounds provide the physical implication that, in the one-shot regime, transmitting \$n\$ bits of classical information is equivalent to \$n{\textbackslash}times k\_BT{\textbackslash}ln2\$ transmitted energy. Unexpectedly, these bounds further uncover a dynamical version of Landauer's principle, showing the strong link between "transmitting" (rather than "erasing") information and energy. Finally, in the asymptotic regime, our findings further provide thermodynamic meanings for Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem and a series of strong converse properties as well as no-go theorems.},

  abstract = {Energy transfer and information transmission are two fundamental aspects of nature. They are seemingly unrelated, while recent findings suggest that a deep connection between them is to be discovered. This amounts to asking: Can we phrase the processes of transmitting classical bits equivalently as specific energy-transmitting tasks, thereby uncovering foundational links between them? We answer this question positively by showing that, for a broad class of classical communication tasks, a quantum dynamics' ability to transmit \$n\$ bits of classical information is equivalent to its ability to transmit \$n\$ units of energy in a thermodynamic task. This finding not only provides an analytical correspondence between information transmission and energy extraction tasks, but also quantifies classical communication by thermodynamics. Furthermore, our findings uncover the dynamical version of Landauer's principle, showing the strong link between transmitting information and energy. In the asymptotic regime, our results further provide thermodynamic meanings for the well-known Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem in quantum communication theory.},

Searching physically meaningful and mathematically rigorous quantifiers of them are long-standing concerns of the community of quantum information science, and various faithful measures have been introduced so far. We review in this paper the measures of discordlike quantum correlations for bipartite and multipartite systems, the measures of quantum coherence for any single quantum system, and their relationship in different settings. Our aim is to provide a full review about the resource theory of quantum coherence, including its application in many-body systems, and the discordlike quantum correlations which were defined based on the various distance measures of states. We discuss the interrelations between quantum coherence and quantum correlations established in an operational way, and the fundamental characteristics of quantum coherence such as their complementarity under different basis sets, their duality with path information of an interference experiment, their distillation and dilution under different operations, and some new viewpoints of the superiority of the quantum algorithms from the perspective of quantum coherence. Additionally, we review properties of geometric quantum correlations and quantum coherence under noisy quantum channels. Finally, the main progresses for the study of quantum correlations and quantum coherence in the relativistic settings are reviewed. All these results provide an overview for the conceptual implications and basic connections of quantum coherence, quantum correlations, and their potential applications in various related subjects of physics.},

  abstract = {Quantum technology has the potential to revolutionize how we acquire and process experimental data to learn about the physical world. An experimental setup that transduces data from a physical system to a stable quantum memory, and processes that data using a quantum computer, could have significant advantages over conventional experiments in which the physical system is measured and the outcomes are processed using a classical computer. We prove that, in various tasks, quantum machines can learn from exponentially fewer experiments than those required in conventional experiments. The exponential advantage holds in predicting properties of physical systems, performing quantum principal component analysis on noisy states, and learning approximate models of physical dynamics. In some tasks, the quantum processing needed to achieve the exponential advantage can be modest; for example, one can simultaneously learn about many noncommuting observables by processing only two copies of the system. Conducting experiments with up to 40 superconducting qubits and 1300 quantum gates, we demonstrate that a substantial quantum advantage can be realized using today's relatively noisy quantum processors. Our results highlight how quantum technology can enable powerful new strategies to learn about nature.},

While quantum devices promise extraordinary capabilities, from exponential computational speedups to unprecedented measurement precision, distinguishing genuine advantages from mere illusions remains a formidable challenge. In this endeavor, quantum theorists are like prophets attempting to foretell the future, yet the boundary between visionary insight and unfounded fantasy is perilously thin. In this perspective, we examine our mathematical tools for navigating the vast world of quantum advantages across computation, learning, sensing, and communication. We explore five keystone properties: predictability, typicality, robustness, verifiability, and usefulness that define an ideal quantum advantage, and envision what new quantum advantages could arise in a future with ubiquitous quantum technology. We prove that some quantum advantages are inherently unpredictable using classical resources alone, suggesting a landscape far richer than what we can currently foresee. While mathematical rigor remains our indispensable guide, the ultimate power of quantum technologies may emerge from advantages we cannot yet conceive.},

  abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the development of systematic effective theories for dissipative thermal systems. Here, we describe an analogous effective theory framework that applies to the classical stochastic dynamics of nonequilibrium systems. We illustrate this approach using a range of examples, including nonreciprocal (predator-prey) dynamics, dissipative and driven rigid-body motion, and active chiral fluids and solids. Many of these systems exhibit a generalized time-reversal symmetry, which plays a crucial role within our formalism, and in many cases can be implemented within the Martin-Siggia-Rose path integral. This effective theory formalism yields generalizations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and second law of thermodynamics valid out of equilibrium. By stipulating a stationary distribution and a set of symmetries -- rather than postulating the stochastic equations of motion directly -- this formalism provides an alternative route to building phenomenological models of driven and active matter. We hope that this approach facilitates a systematic investigation of the universality classes of active matter, and provides a common language for nonequilibrium many-body physics from high energy to condensed matter.},

Here, we build an effective field theory for SWSSB of a global U(1) symmetry; the answer exactly reproduces the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory of diffusion for the conserved charge. We conclude that hydrodynamics can be understood as a theory of "superfluidity" for the broken strong symmetry: a non-vanishing susceptibility is a measurable order parameter for SWSSB, the diffusion mode is the Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, and a generalization of Goldstone's Theorem implies that the diffusion mode is always long-lived. This perspective provides a transparent physical explanation for the unusual "reparameterization" symmetries which are a necessary ingredient of Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for "normal fluids".},

To put the AdS/CFT correspondence into historical context, we start by reviewing the relevant aspects of string theory (of which no prior knowledge is assumed). We then develop the statement of the correspondence, and explain how the two sides of the duality map into each other. Finally, we discuss the implications and applications of the correspondence, and indicate some of the current trends in this subject.

In particular, we argue that the entanglement entropy associated with a specified region on the boundary in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence is given by the area of a co-dimension two bulk surface with vanishing expansions of null geodesics. We demonstrate our construction with several examples to illustrate its reduction to the holographic entanglement entropy proposal in static spacetimes. We further show how this proposal may be used to understand the time evolution of entanglement entropy in a time varying QFT state dual to a collapsing black hole background. Finally, we use our proposal to argue that the Euclidean wormhole geometries with multiple boundaries should be regarded as states in a non-interacting but entangled set of QFTs, one associated to each boundary.},

Here we demonstrate that an electromagnetic wave scattered at an object carries locally defined and conserved information about all of the object's constitutive parameters. Specifically, we introduce the density and flux of Fisher information for general types of wave fields and identify the corresponding sources and sinks of information through which all these new quantities satisfy a fundamental continuity equation. We experimentally verify our theoretical predictions by studying a movable object embedded in a disordered environment and by measuring the corresponding Fisher information flux at microwave frequencies.

It is becoming clear, however, that thermal relaxation is much more intricate when temperature changes push the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, by using an optically trapped colloidal particle, we show that microscale systems under such conditions heat up faster than they cool down. We find that between any pair of temperatures, heating is not only faster than cooling but the respective processes, in fact, evolve along fundamentally distinct pathways, which we explain with a new theoretical framework that we call thermal kinematics.

These relations can be interpreted as the relations between accuracy and the speed of the diffusion dynamics in the absence of the nonconservative force. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory.

To demonstrate the concept, we explore a (1+1)-dimensional chiral Dirac system and execute the protocol for the electric current and charge. One of the most significant results is the creation of long-range correlations across the system after applying control operations only to one local site. Consequently but surprisingly, the induced charge susceptibility fully reconstructs the phase diagram, despite the model initially having no charge. Moreover, we find an activation of novel chiral dynamics induced by feedback control operations, which can be experimentally confirmed using trapped ions and neutral atoms.},

  abstract = {We study the behavior of the excitation spectrum across the quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a supersolid phase of a dipolar Bose gas confined to a one-dimensional geometry. Including the leading beyond-mean-field effects within an effective Hamiltonian, the analysis is based on Bogoliubov theory with several order parameters accounting for the superfluid as well as solid structure. We find fast convergence of the ground-state energy in the supersolid with the number of order parameters and demonstrate a stable excitation spectrum with two Goldstone modes and an amplitude mode in the low-energy regime. Our results suggest that there exists an experimentally achievable parameter regime for dysprosium atoms, where the supersolid phase exhibits a stable excitation spectrum in the thermodynamic limit and the transition into the supersolid phase is of second order driven by the roton instability.},

  abstract = {The striking success of the Standard Model in explaining precision data and, at the same time, its lack of explanations for various fundamental phenomena, such as dark matter or the baryon asymmetry of the universe, suggests new physics at an energy scale much larger than the electroweak scale. In the absence of a short-range-long-range conspiracy, the Standard Model can be viewed as the leading term of an effective "remnant" theory (referred to as the SMEFT) of a more fundamental structure. Over the last years, many aspects of the SMEFT have been investigated and it has become a standard tool to analyze experimental results in an integral way. In this article, after briefly presenting the salient features of the Standard Model, we review the construction of the SMEFT. We discuss the range of its applicability and bounds on its coefficients imposed by general theoretical considerations. Since new physics models are likely to exhibit exact or approximate accidental global symmetries, especially in the flavor sector, we also discuss their implications for the SMEFT. The main focus of our review is the phenomenological analysis of experimental results. We show explicitly how to use various effective field theories to study the phenomenology of theories beyond the Standard Model. We give a detailed description of the matching procedure and the use of the renormalization group equations, allowing to connect multiple effective theories valid at different energy scales. Explicit examples from low-energy experiments and from high-\$p\_T\$ physics illustrate the workflow. We also comment on the non-linear realization of the electroweak symmetry breaking and its phenomenological implications.},

A local magnetic field is applied at the edge sites to control the degree of the ground-state entanglement. In the teleportation protocol, an energy sender performs a projective measurement at one edge site, while an energy receiver performs a feedback control at the other edge site dependent on the measurement result to extract energy. We find that the energy extracted by the receiver takes a maximum at intermediate value of the local magnetic field. We also find that this magnetic-field behavior is almost proportional to entropy changes due to the feedback control. The role of a feedback control in an entropy change is discussed in terms of entanglement thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {We study the effectiveness of quantum error correction against coherent noise. Coherent errors (for example, unitary noise) can interfere constructively, so that in some cases the average infidelity of a quantum circuit subjected to coherent errors may increase quadratically with the circuit size; in contrast, when errors are incoherent (for example, depolarizing noise), the average infidelity increases at worst linearly with circuit size. We consider the performance of quantum stabilizer codes against a noise model in which a unitary rotation is applied to each qubit, where the axes and angles of rotation are nearly the same for all qubits. In particular, we show that for the toric code subject to such independent coherent noise, and for minimal-weight decoding, the logical channel after error correction becomes increasingly incoherent as the length of the code increases, provided the noise strength decays inversely with the code distance. A similar conclusion holds for weakly correlated coherent noise. Our methods can also be used for analyzing the performance of other codes and fault-tolerant protocols against coherent noise. However, our result does not show that the coherence of the logical channel is suppressed in the more physically relevant case where the noise strength is held constant as the code block grows, and we recount the difficulties that prevented us from extending the result to that case. Nevertheless our work supports the idea that fault-tolerant quantum computing schemes will work effectively against coherent noise, providing encouraging news for quantum hardware builders who worry about the damaging effects of control errors and coherent interactions with the environment.},

Although the entanglement entropy depends upon the matter field content of the theory, it turns out that so does the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy \$A/4{\textbackslash}backslashhbar G\_\{ren\}\$, in precisely the same way, because the effective gravitational constant \$G\_\{ren\}\$ is renormalized by the very same quantum fluctuations. It appears most satisfactory if the entire gravitational action is ``induced", in the manner suggested by Sakharov, since then the black hole entropy is purebred entanglement entropy, rather than being hybrid with bare gravitational entropy (whatever that might be.)}

In particular, we prove a fluctuation relation describing an asymmetry between energy absorbing and releasing processes which relies on the non-unital nature of the underlying quantum map. This allows us to derive a bound on the average energy exchanged. We find that energy releasing processes are dominant when the kinetic energy of the particle is comparable to the system energies, but are forbidden at very high kinetic energies where well known fluctuation relations are recovered. Our work provides a unified view of energy fluctuations when the source driving the system is not macroscopic but rather an auxiliary quantum particle in a scattering process.},

  abstract = {Quantum sensing using optically addressable atomic-scale defects, such as the nitrogen--vacancy (NV) center in diamond, provides new opportunities for sensitive and highly localized characterization of chemical functionality. Notably, near-surface defects facilitate detection of the minute magnetic fields generated by nuclear or electron spins outside of the diamond crystal, such as those in chemisorbed and physisorbed molecules. However, the promise of NV centers is hindered by a severe degradation of critical sensor properties, namely charge stability and spin coherence, near surfaces ({$<$} ca. 10 nm deep). Moreover, applications in the chemical sciences require methods for covalent bonding of target molecules to diamond with robust control over density, orientation, and binding configuration. This forward-looking Review provides a survey of the rapidly converging fields of diamond surface science and NV-center physics, highlighting their combined potential for quantum sensing of molecules. We outline the diamond surface properties that are advantageous for NV-sensing applications, and discuss strategies to mitigate deleterious effects while simultaneously providing avenues for chemical attachment. Finally, we present an outlook on emerging applications in which the unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution of NV-based sensing could provide unique insight into chemically functionalized surfaces at the single-molecule level.},

We develop a theoretical framework for active reservoir engineering, where time-dependent control over a quantum system is used to manipulate its environment. In this case, the system may act as an entropy sink for the environment. Our framwork captures the dynamical interplay between system and environment, and provides an intuitive picture of how finite-size effects and system-environment correlations allow for manipulating the environment by repeated initialization of the quantum system. We illustrate our results with two examples: a superconducting qubit coupled to an environment of two-level systems and a semiconducting quantum dot coupled to nuclear spins. In both scenarios, we find qualitative agreement with previous experimental results, illustrating how active control can unlock new functionalities in open quantum systems.},

  abstract = {Particle accelerators and storage rings have been transformative instruments of discovery, and, for many applications, innovations in particle-beam cooling have been a principal driver of that success1. Beam cooling reduces the spread in particle positions and momenta, while keeping the number of particles constant, and combats diffusive effects, thereby enabling particle accumulation and the production and preservation of intense beams. In the case of particle colliders, cooling increases the likelihood of observing rare physics events. One of the most important conceptual and technological advances in this area was stochastic cooling (SC), which was instrumental in the discovery of the W and Z bosons at CERN and the top quark at Fermilab2-6. SC reduces the random motion of the beam particles through granular sampling and correction of the beams phase-space structure, thus bearing resemblance to a Maxwells demon. The extension of SC from the microwave regime up to optical frequencies and bandwidths has long been pursued as it could increase the achievable cooling rates by three to four orders of magnitude and provide a powerful new tool for future accelerators. First proposed nearly thirty years ago, Optical Stochastic Cooling (OSC) replaces the conventional microwave elements of SC with optical-frequency analogs and is, in principle, compatible with any species of charged-particle beam7,8. Here we describe the first experimental demonstration of OSC in a proof-of-principle experiment9 at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratorys Integrable Optics Test Accelerator10.},

As we turn our attention to smaller systems, however, statistical fluctuations become more prominent. In recent years it has become apparent that the fluctuations of systems far from thermal equilibrium are not mere background noise, but satisfy strong, useful, and unexpected properties. In particular, a proper accounting of fluctuations allows us to rewrite familiar inequalities of macroscopic thermodynamics as equalities. This review describes some of this progress, and argues that it has refined our understanding of irreversibility and the second law.},

We show that collective effects in open quantum systems can be harnessed to develop highly consistent many-body quantum engines. We consider quantum Otto engines, modeled by \$n\$ spins collectively coupled to thermal baths. Our results show that collective effects can significantly reduce the fluctuations in the output work, quantified by high reliability (\$r\$) and low thermodynamic uncertainty. In contrast to independent engines, we demonstrate a quadratic enhancement of the reliability \$r\$ for their collective counterparts. We extend our analysis to the case of interacting spin models commonly studied in many-body physics, such as the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, thereby broadening the regime of applicability of collective effects in quantum thermal machines significantly. This paves the way forward for realistic collective quantum thermal machines in many body systems.},

We report the findings of a dedicated one-day workshop that included Canadian stakeholders from government, industry and academia to gather inputs and insights for the applications and technical road-map. We also provide an overview of the Quantum EncrYption and Science Satellite (QEYSSat) mission expected to launch in 2024-2025 and its anticipated outcomes. One of the main outcomes of this study is that developing the main elements for a Canada-wide quantum internet will have the highest level of impact, which includes Canada-wide entanglement distribution and teleportation. We present and analyze a possible future mission ('QEYSSat 2.0') that would enable a long range quantum teleportation across Canada as an important step towards this vision.},

Extending work by Partovi, we consider a general entangled multipartite system that allows large reversals of the thermodynamic arrow of time. We describe a hierarchy of arrows that arises from the different correlations allowed in a quantum state and examine these features in the context of Maxwell's Demon.

  abstract = {We study scattering in Ising Field Theory (IFT) using matrix product states and the time-dependent variational principle. IFT is a one-parameter family of strongly coupled non-integrable quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions, interpolating between massive free fermion theory and Zamolodchikov's integrable massive \$E\_8\$ theory. Particles in IFT may scatter either elastically or inelastically. In the post-collision wavefunction, particle tracks from all final-state channels occur in superposition; processes of interest can be isolated by projecting the wavefunction onto definite particle sectors, or by evaluating energy density correlation functions. Using numerical simulations we determine the time delay of elastic scattering and the probability of inelastic particle production as a function of collision energy. We also study the mass and width of the lightest resonance near the \$E\_8\$ point in detail. Close to both the free fermion and \$E\_8\$ theories, our results for both elastic and inelastic scattering are in good agreement with expectations from form-factor perturbation theory. Using numerical computations to go beyond the regime accessible by perturbation theory, we find that the high energy behavior of the two-to-two particle scattering probability in IFT is consistent with a conjecture of Zamolodchikov. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of tensor-network methods for simulating the real-time dynamics of strongly coupled quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions.},

  abstract = {The thought experiment of Maxwell's demon highlights the effect of side information in thermodynamics. In this paper, we present an axiomatic treatment of a quantum Maxwell's demon, by introducing a resource-theoretic framework of quantum thermodynamics in the presence of quantum side information. Under minimal operational assumptions that capture the demon's behaviour, we derive the one-shot work costs of preparing, as well as erasing, a thermodynamic system whose coupling with the demon's mind is described by a bipartite quantum state. With trivial Hamiltonians, these work costs are precisely captured by the smoothed conditional min- and max-entropies, respectively, thus providing operational interpretations for these one-shot information-theoretic quantities in microscopic thermodynamics. An immediate, information-theoretic implication of our results is an affirmative proof of the conjectured maximality of the conditional max-entropy among all axiomatically plausible conditional entropies, complementing the recently established minimality of the conditional min-entropy. We then generalize our main results to the setting with nontrivial Hamiltonians, wherein the work costs of preparation and erasure are captured by a generalized type of mutual information. Finally, we present a macroscopic second law of thermodynamics in the presence of quantum side information, in terms of a conditional version of the Helmholtz free energy. Our results extend the conceptual connection between thermodynamics and quantum information theory by refining the axiomatic common ground between the two theories and revealing fundamental insights of each theory in light of the other.},

The theory enables us to study transient quantum transport in nanostructures with back-reaction effects from the contacts, with non-Markovian dissipation and decoherence being fully taken into account. For a simple illustration, we apply the theory to a single-electron transistor subjected to ac bias voltages. The non-Markovian memory structure and the nonlinear response functions describing transient electron transport are obtained.},

Phys. 18, 033014 (2016)] the non-relativistic description of fermions is considered and in particular the role of the parity superselection rule in relation to the characterization of entanglement. An argument based on the spin-statistics connection is presented as a physical motivation for the parity superselection rule. Since the spin statistics connection was derived in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics it is argued that the inclusion of the parity superselection rule is motivated by Lorentz invariance. Based on this it is further argued that fermionic Quantum Information theory and the theory of special relativity are conceptually inseparable. In this comment a different, and well known, motivation for the parity superselection rule is given that does not rely on arguments from relativistic quantum mechanics, but instead uses the assumptions that the laws of physics are the same for different observers and the no-signalling principle.},

Using a self-consistent Gutzwiller diagonalisation approach, we study the mean-field ground state properties of a long-range interacting atomic gas in a one-dimensional optical lattice. We first confirm that the inclusion of long-range two-body interactions to the standard Bose-Hubbard model introduces density wave and supersolid phases. However, the introduction of pair and density-dependent tunnelling can result in new phases with two-site periodic density, single-particle transport and two-body transport order parameters. These staggered phases are potentially a mean-field signature of the known novel twisted superfluids found via a DMRG approach [PRA \${\textbackslash}backslash\$textbf\{94\}, 011603(R) (2016)].

  abstract = {There has been a surge of recent interest in the Wigner's Friend paradox, sparking several novel thought experiments and no-go theorems. The main narrative has been that Wigner's Friend highlights a counterintuitive feature that is unique to quantum theory, and which is closely related to the quantum measurement problem. Here, we challenge this view. We argue that the gist of the Wigner's Friend paradox can be reproduced without assuming quantum physics, and that it underlies a much broader class of enigmas in the foundations of physics and philosophy. To show this, we first consider several recently proposed Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios, and demonstrate that some of their implications for the absoluteness of observations can be reproduced by classical thought experiments that involve the duplication of agents. Crucially, some of these classical scenarios are technologically much easier to implement than their quantum counterparts. Then, we argue that the essential structural ingredient of all these scenarios is a feature that we call "Restriction A": essentially, that a physical theory cannot give us a probabilistic description of the observations of all agents. Finally, we argue that this difficulty is at the core of other puzzles in the foundations of physics and philosophy, and demonstrate this explicitly for cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem. Our analysis suggests that Wigner's Friend should be studied in a larger context, addressing a frontier of human knowledge beyond quantum foundations: to obtain reliable predictions for experiments in which these predictions can be privately but not intersubjectively verified.},

Namely, e.g., phase modulated signalling (Alice using, e.g., {\textbar}+{$>$},{\textbar}e{$>$}-states) overcomes the quantum noise already at a lower order in perturbation theory. Second, we study the effect of mode truncations that are commonly used in cavity QED on the modelling of the communication between two-level atoms. We show that, on general grounds, namely for causality to be preserved, the UV cutoff must scale at least polynomially with the desired accuracy of the predictions.},

  abstract = {Information and energy are concepts central to our understanding of nature. Their relevance, in physics, ranges from fundamental physics, e.g., in black hole physics, all the way to future quantum computing technology. This thesis investigates how information and energy propagate in quantum fields. The main result is that in massless fields the propagation of information can decouple from the propagation of energy partially and, under special circumstances, even completely. It has been known that in general curved spacetimes, and also in odd-dimensional Minkowski space, signals can propagate slower than light even in a massless field. Here it is shown that the energy-to-information ratio of these classical timelike signals can approach zero. The extreme case is marked by two-dimensional Minkowski space. In this case, timelike signals reach arbitrarily far into the future lightcone, without diluting, and they carry no energy at all. Instead, the energy cost associated with the detection of energyless signals has to be provided by the receiver, much as in a collect call. Technically, sender and receiver are modelled as basic first-quantized systems coupling locally to the relativistic quantum field, i.e., as Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors. This gives rise to a standard quantum channel from the sender to the receiver. Thus, the tools of quantum information can be applied to investigate the combined impact of relativistic and quantum effects on the propagation of information. In the perturbative regime, signals analogous to phase modulation are shown to over- come signals analogous to amplitude modulation: It is shown that the sender has to prepare superpositions of eigenstates, to achieve signalling effects at leading order. Signals from pure energy eigenstates are subdominant, and only appear in next-to-leading order. The classical channel capacities resulting from optimal signalling states are calculated. Analyzing the energy injected into the field by the sender, it is shown that signals reach further in spacetime than the energy radiated by the sender, both for timelike, as well as for lightlike signals. Instead, the energy budget is balanced by the energy that the receiver has to provide when decoupling the detector from the field. This switching cost is particularly sensitive to timelike signals. Timelike signals are also demonstrated to occur between harmonic oscillators coupling to the field inside a cavity. This model could be instrumental for future research, because it can be treated non-perturbatively using Gaussian methods. Such numerical calculations only take into account a finite number of field modes. It is shown that relativistic properties of the field can still be resolved reliably, because the number of necessary modes scales with the desired accuracy, namely following a power law.},

Using a Clifford algebra formalism we show that arbitrary uniform families of circuits of these gates, restricted to act only on nearest neighbour (n.n.) qubit lines, can be classically efficiently simulated. This reproduces a result originally proved by Valiant using his matchgate formalism, and subsequently related by others to free fermionic physics. We further show that if the n.n. condition is slightly relaxed, to allowing the same gates to act only on n.n. and next-n.n. qubit lines, then the resulting circuits can efficiently perform universal quantum computation. From this point of view, the gap between efficient classical and quantum computational power is bridged by a very modest use of a seemingly innocuous resource (qubit swapping). We also extend the simulation result above in various ways. In particular, by exploiting properties of Clifford operations in conjunction with the Jordan-Wigner representation of a Clifford algebra, we show how one may generalise the simulation result above to provide further classes of classically efficiently simulatable quantum circuits, which we call Gaussian quantum circuits.},

  abstract = {Catalysis plays a key role in many scientific areas, most notably in chemistry and biology. Here we present a catalytic process in a paradigmatic quantum optics setup, namely the Jaynes-Cummings model, where an atom interacts with an optical cavity. The atom plays the role of the catalyst, and allows for the deterministic generation of non-classical light in the cavity. Considering a cavity prepared in a ``classical'' coherent state, and choosing appropriately the atomic state and the interaction time, we obtain an evolution with the following properties. First, the state of the cavity has been modified, and now features non-classicality, as witnessed by sub-Poissonian statistics or Wigner negativity. Second, the process is catalytic, in the sense that the atom is deterministically returned to its initial state exactly, and can be re-used multiple times. What is more, we also show that our findings are robust under dissipation and can be applied to scenarios featuring cavity loss and atomic decay. Finally, we investigate the mechanism of this catalytic process, in particular highlighting the key role of correlations and quantum coherence.},

  abstract = {Reduced density matrices are a powerful tool in the analysis of entanglement structure, approximate or coarse-grained dynamics, decoherence, and the emergence of classicality. It is straightforward to produce a reduced density matrix with the partial-trace map by ``tracing out'' part of the quantum state, but in many natural situations this reduction may not be achievable. We investigate the general problem of identifying how the quantum state reduces given a restriction on the observables. For example, in an experimental setting, the set of observables that can actually be measured is usually modest (compared to the set of all possible observables) and their resolution is limited. In such situations, the appropriate state-reduction map can be defined via a generalized bipartition, which is associated with the structure of irreducible representations of the algebra generated by the restricted set of observables. One of our main technical results is a general, not inherently numeric, algorithm for finding irreducible representations of matrix algebras. We demonstrate the viability of this approach with two examples of limited--resolution observables. The definition of quantum state reductions can also be extended beyond algebras of observables. To accomplish this task we introduce a more flexible notion of bipartition, the partial bipartition, which describes coarse-grainings preserving information about a limited set (not necessarily algebra) of observables. We describe a variational method to choose the coarse-grainings most compatible with a specified Hamiltonian, which exhibit emergent classicality in the reduced state space. We apply this construction to the concrete example of the 1-D Ising model. Our results have relevance for quantum information, bulk reconstruction in holography, and quantum gravity.},

We present a concrete quantitative model for ER=EPR, in which two spin-1/2 particles in a singlet state are connected by a nontraversable wormhole in asymptotically flat general relativity.

We use these solutions as initial data and numerically evolve them forward in time. Our simulations show that black holes form, which are connected by the wormhole and which render the wormhole nontraversable.

  abstract = {Recently, the European Commission supported by many European countries has announced large investments towards the commercialization of quantum technology (QT) to address and mitigate some of the biggest challenges facing today's digital era - e.g. secure communication and computing power. For more than two decades the QT community has been working on the development of QTs, which promise landmark breakthroughs leading to commercialization in various areas. The ambitious goals of the QT community and expectations of EU authorities cannot be met solely by individual initiatives of single countries, and therefore, require a combined European effort of large and unprecedented dimensions comparable only to the Galileo or Copernicus programs. Strong international competition calls for a coordinated European effort towards the development of QT in and for space, including research and development of technology in the areas of communication and sensing. Here, we aim at summarizing the state of the art in the development of quantum technologies which have an impact in the field of space applications. Our goal is to outline a complete framework for the design, development, implementation, and exploitation of quantum technology in space.},

  abstract = {It was recently shown by Harlow that any quantum error correcting code, satisfying the same complementary recovery properties as AdS/CFT, will obey a version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. In his most general result, Harlow allowed the bulk algebras to have nontrivial center, which was necessary for the "area operator" in this Ryu-Takayanagi formula to be nontrivial. However, the boundary Hilbert space was still assumed to factorise into Hilbert spaces associated with complementary boundary regions. We extend this work to include more general boundary theories, such as gauge theories, where the subalgebras associated with boundary regions may also have nontrivial center. We show the equivalence of a set of four conditions for a bulk algebra to be reconstructable from a boundary algebra, and then show that complementary recovery implies that the algebraic boundary entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi formula. In contrast, we show that the distillable boundary entropy does not obey any such formula. If an additional "log dim R" term is added to the algebraic entropy, it will still obey a Ryu-Takayanagi formula, with a different area operator. However, since the "log dim R" term is a sum over local boundary contributions, we argue that it can only be related to the regularisation of the area at the bulk cut-off.},

  abstract = {We add non-linear and state-dependent terms to quantum field theory. We show that the resulting low-energy theory, non-linear quantum mechanics, is causal, preserves probability and permits a consistent description of the process of measurement. We explore the consequences of such terms and show that non-linear quantum effects can be observed in macroscopic systems even in the presence of de-coherence. We find that current experimental bounds on these non-linearities are weak and propose several experimental methods to significantly probe these effects. The locally exploitable effects of these non-linearities have enormous technological implications. For example, they would allow large scale parallelization of computing (in fact, any other effort) and enable quantum sensing beyond the standard quantum limit. We also expose a fundamental vulnerability of any non-linear modification of quantum mechanics - these modifications are highly sensitive to cosmic history and their locally exploitable effects can dynamically disappear if the observed universe has a tiny overlap with the overall quantum state of the universe, as is predicted in conventional inflationary cosmology. We identify observables that persist in this case and discuss opportunities to detect them in cosmic ray experiments, tests of strong field general relativity and current probes of the equation of state of the universe. Non-linear quantum mechanics also enables novel gravitational phenomena and may open new directions to solve the black hole information problem and uncover the theory underlying quantum field theory and gravitation.},

  abstract = {We compute how an accelerating qubit coupled to a scalar field - i.e. an Unruh-DeWitt detector - evolves in flat space, with an emphasis on its late-time behaviour. When calculable, the qubit evolves towards a thermal state for a field prepared in the Minkowski vacuum, with the approach to this limit controlled by two different time-scales. For a free field we compute both of these as functions of the difference between qubit energy levels, the dimensionless qubit/field coupling constant, the scalar field mass and the qubit's proper acceleration. Both time-scales differ from the Candelas-Deutsch-Sciama transition rate traditionally computed for Unruh-DeWitt detectors, which we show describes the qubit's early-time evolution away from the vacuum rather than its late-time approach to equilibrium. For small enough couplings and sufficiently late times the evolution is Markovian and described by a Lindblad equation, which we derive in detail from first principles as a special instance of Open EFT methods designed to handle a breakdown of late-time perturbative predictions due to the presence of secular growth. We show how this growth is resummed in this example to give reliable information about late-time evolution including both qubit/field interactions and field self-interactions. By allowing very explicit treatment, the qubit/field system allows a systematic assessment of the approximations needed when exploring late-time evolution, in a way that lends itself to gravitational applications. It also allows a comparison of these approximations with those - e.g. the `rotating-wave' approximation - widely made in the open-system literature (which is aimed more at atomic transitions and lasers).},

Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly covariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.},

As an illustrative example of open quantum bosonic systems, we study symmetry classes of dissipative quantum spin models. For open quantum fermionic systems, we develop the \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_4\$ classification of fermion parity symmetry and antiunitary symmetry in the double Hilbert space, which contrasts with the \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_8\$ classification in closed quantum systems.

  abstract = {We develop a complete theory of symmetry and topology in non-Hermitian physics. We demonstrate that non-Hermiticity ramifies the celebrated Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification for insulators and superconductors. In particular, charge conjugation is defined in terms of transposition rather than complex conjugation due to the lack of Hermiticity, and hence chiral symmetry becomes distinct from sublattice symmetry. It is also shown that non-Hermiticity enables a Hermitian-conjugate counterpart of the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry. Taking into account sublattice symmetry or pseudo-Hermiticity as an additional symmetry, the total number of symmetry classes is 38 instead of 10, which describe intrinsic non-Hermitian topological phases as well as non-Hermitian random matrices. Furthermore, due to the complex nature of energy spectra, non-Hermitian systems feature two different types of complex-energy gaps, point-like and line-like vacant regions. On the basis of these concepts and K-theory, we complete classification of non-Hermitian topological phases in arbitrary dimensions and symmetry classes. Remarkably, non-Hermitian topology depends on the type of complex-energy gaps and multiple topological structures appear for each symmetry class and each spatial dimension, which are also illustrated in detail with concrete examples. Moreover, the bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems is elucidated within our framework, and symmetries preventing the non-Hermitian skin effect are identified. Our classification not only categorizes recently observed lasing and transport topological phenomena, but also predicts a new type of symmetry-protected topological lasers with lasing helical edge states and dissipative topological superconductors with nonorthogonal Majorana edge states. Furthermore, our theory provides topological classification of Hermitian and non-Hermitian free bosons.},

Here, we develop a field-theoretical description of the intrinsic non-Hermitian topological phases. Because of the dissipative and nonequilibrium nature of non-Hermiticity, our theory is formulated solely in terms of spatial degrees of freedom, which contrasts with the conventional theory defined in spacetime. It provides the universal understanding about non-Hermitian topological phenomena, such as the unidirectional transport in one dimension and the chiral magnetic skin effect in three dimensions. Furthermore, it systematically predicts new physics; we illustrate this by revealing transport phenomena and skin effects in two dimensions induced by a perpendicular spatial texture. From the field-theoretical perspective, the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is anomalous localization due to non-Hermiticity, is shown to be a signature of an anomaly.},

  abstract = {This is a preliminary version of a book in progress on the theory of quantum communication. We adopt an information-theoretic perspective throughout and give a comprehensive account of fundamental results in quantum communication theory from the past decade (and earlier), with an emphasis on the modern one-shot-to-asymptotic approach that underlies much of today's state-of-the-art research in this field. In Part I, we cover mathematical preliminaries and provide a detailed study of quantum mechanics from an information-theoretic perspective. We also provide an extensive and thorough review of quantum entropies, and we devote an entire chapter to the study of entanglement measures. Equipped with these essential tools, in Part II we study classical communication (with and without entanglement assistance), entanglement distillation, quantum communication, secret key distillation, and private communication. In Part III, we cover the latest developments in feedback-assisted communication tasks, such as quantum and classical feedback-assisted communication, LOCC-assisted quantum communication, and secret key agreement.},

  abstract = {It is well known that both the symplectic structure and the Poisson brackets of classical field theory can be constructed directly from the Lagrangian in a covariant way, without passing through the noncovariant canonical Hamiltonian formalism. This is true even in the presence of constraints and gauge symmetries. These constructions go under the names of the covariant phase space formalism and the Peierls bracket. We review both of them, paying more careful attention, than usual, to the precise mathematical hypotheses that they require, illustrating them in examples. Also an extensive historical overview of the development of these constructions is provided. The novel aspect of our presentation is a significant expansion and generalization of an elegant and quite recent argument by Forger and Romero showing the equivalence between the resulting symplectic and Poisson structures without passing through the canonical Hamiltonian formalism as an intermediary. We generalize it to cover theories with constraints and gauge symmetries and formulate precise sufficient conditions under which the argument holds. These conditions include a local condition on the equations of motion that we call hyperbolizability, and some global conditions of cohomological nature. The details of our presentation may shed some light on subtle questions related to the Poisson structure of gauge theories and their quantization.}

  abstract = {Superconducting qubits typically use a dispersive readout scheme, where a resonator is coupled to a qubit such that its frequency is qubit-state dependent. Measurement is performed by driving the resonator, where the transmitted resonator field yields information about the resonator frequency and thus the qubit state. Ideally, we could use arbitrarily strong resonator drives to achieve a target signal-to-noise ratio in the shortest possible time. However, experiments have shown that when the average resonator photon number exceeds a certain threshold, the qubit is excited out of its computational subspace in a process we refer to as a measurement-induced state transition (MIST). These transitions degrade readout fidelity, and constitute leakage which precludes further operation of the qubit in, for example, error correction. Here we study these transitions experimentally with a transmon qubit by measuring their dependence on qubit frequency, average resonator photon number, and qubit state, in the regime where the resonator frequency is lower than the qubit frequency. We observe signatures of resonant transitions between levels in the coupled qubit-resonator system that exhibit noisy behavior when measured repeatedly in time. We provide a semi-classical model of these transitions based on the rotating wave approximation and use it to predict the onset of state transitions in our experiments. Our results suggest the transmon is excited to levels near the top of its cosine potential following a state transition, where the charge dispersion of higher transmon levels explains the observed noisy behavior of state transitions. Moreover, we show that occupation in these higher energy levels poses a major challenge for fast qubit reset.},

  abstract = {The success of quantum physics in description of various physical interaction phenomena relies primarily on the accuracy of analytical methods used. In quantum mechanics, many of such interactions such as those found in quantum optomechanics and quantum computing have a highly nonlinear nature, which makes their analysis extraordinarily difficult using classical schemes. Typically, modern quantum systems of interest nowadays come with four basic properties: (i) quantumness, (ii) openness, (iii) randomness, and (iv) nonlinearity. The newly introduced method of higher-order operators targets analytical solutions to such systems, and while providing at least mathematically approximate expressions with improved accuracy over the fully linearized schemes, some cases admit exact solutions. Many different applications of this method in quantum and classically nonlinear systems are demonstrated throughout. This review is purposed to provide the reader with ease of access to this recent and well-established operator algebra, while going over a moderate amount of literature review. The reader with basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and quantum noise theory should be able to start using this scheme to his or her own problem of interest.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing promises to offer substantial speed-ups over its classical counterpart for certain problems. However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize1 and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the measured expectation values by comparing them with the output of exactly verifiable circuits. In the regime of strong entanglement, the quantum computer provides correct results for which leading classical approximations such as pure-state-based 1D (matrix product states,~MPS) and 2D (isometric tensor network states, isoTNS) tensor network methods2,3 break down. These experiments demonstrate a foundational tool for the realization of near-term quantum applications4,5.},

  abstract = {Distributed quantum sensing, which estimates a global parameter across distant nodes, has attracted significant interest for applications such as quantum imaging, sensor networks, and global-scale clock synchronization. \$N00N\$ states are regarded as one of the optimal quantum resources for quantum metrology, enabling the Heisenberg scaling. Recently, the concept of \$N00N\$ states has been extended to multi-mode \$N00N\$ states for quantum-enhanced multiple-parameter estimation. However, the application of multi-mode \$N00N\$ states in distributed quantum sensing remains unexplored. Here, we propose a distributed quantum sensing scheme that achieves the Heisenberg scaling using multi-mode \$N00N\$ states. We theoretically show that multi-mode \$N00N\$ states can reach the Heisenberg scaling by examining both the Cram{\textbackslash}'er-Rao bound and the quantum Cram{\textbackslash}'er-Rao bound. For experimental demonstration, we employ a four-mode \$2002\$ state to estimate the average of two spatially distributed phases, achieving a 2.74 dB sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum limit. We believe that utilizing multi-mode \$N00N\$ states for distributed quantum sensing offers a promising approach for developing entanglement-enhanced sensor networks.},

  abstract = {The Dicke model describes the coupling between a quantized cavity field and a large ensemble of two-level atoms. When the number of atoms tends to infinity, this model can undergo a transition to a superradiant phase, belonging to the mean-field Ising universality class. The superradiant transition was first predicted for atoms in thermal equilibrium and was recently realized with a quantum simulator made of atoms in an optical cavity, subject to both dissipation and driving. In this Progress Report, we offer an introduction to some theoretical concepts relevant to the Dicke model, reviewing the critical properties of the superradiant phase transition, and the distinction between equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. In addition, we explain the fundamental difference between the superradiant phase transition and the more common lasing transition. Our report mostly focuses on the steady states of atoms in single-mode optical cavities, but we also mention some aspects of real-time dynamics, as well as other quantum simulators, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and using spin-orbit coupling for cold atoms. These realizations differ in regard to whether they describe equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems.},

It is often called a duality because it is an equivalence between two different, "dual" descriptions of the same physics. On one side of the duality are certain quantum field theories (QFTs) - for example, Yang-Mills gauge theories similar to those in the standard model of particle physics. Such theories describe interacting particles moving in a flat d-dimensional spacetime. On the other side are theories that include gravity, like Albert Einstein's general relativity or its string-theoretic generalizations. The gravitational theories are defined in a higher-dimensional spacetime containing at least the d dimensions of the particle theory plus one extra dimension of infinite extent. They often include a number of finite dimensions - in the form of a sphere, for example. Depending on the context, the correspondence is known as a gauge/gravity duality, gauge/string duality, or AdS/CFT (anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory) correspondence. Do not despair if the terminology is unclear. In this article we will attempt to describe in simple terms what the duality is and how and why it is useful for studying a variety of problems. {\copyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.}

  abstract = {There are two complementary approaches to realizing quantum information so that it is protected from a given set of error operators. Both involve encoding information by means of subsystems. One is initialization-based error protection, which involves a quantum operation that is applied before error events occur. The other is operator quantum error correction, which uses a recovery operation applied after the errors. Together, the two approaches make it clear how quantum information can be stored at all stages of a process involving alternating error and quantum operations. In particular, there is always a subsystem that faithfully represents the desired quantum information. We give a definition of faithful realization of quantum information and show that it always involves subsystems. This justifies the "subsystems principle" for realizing quantum information. In the presence of errors, one can make use of noiseless, (initialization) protectable, or error-correcting subsystems. We give an explicit algorithm for finding optimal noiseless subsystems. Finding optimal protectable or error-correcting subsystems is in general difficult. Verifying that a subsystem is error-correcting involves only linear algebra. We discuss the verification problem for protectable subsystems and reduce it to a simpler version of the problem of finding error-detecting codes.},

  abstract = {Quantum error correction will be necessary for preserving coherent states against noise and other unwanted interactions in quantum computation and communication. We develop a general theory of quantum error correction based on encoding states into larger Hilbert spaces subject to known interactions. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the perfect recovery of an encoded state after its degradation by an interaction. The conditions depend only on the behavior of the logical states. We use them to give a recovery-operator-independent definition of error-correcting codes. We relate this definition to four others: the existence of a left inverse of the interaction, an explicit representation of the error syndrome using tensor products, perfect recovery of the completely entangled state, and an information theoretic identity. Two notions of fidelity and error for imperfect recovery are introduced, one for pure and the other for entangled states. The latter is more appropriate when using codes in a quantum memory or in applications of quantum teleportation to communication. We show that the error for entangled states is bounded linearly by the error for pure states. A formal definition of independent interactions for qubits is given. This leads to lower bounds on the number of qubits required to correct e errors and a formal proof that the classical bounds on the probability of error of e-error-correcting codes applies to e-error-correcting quantum codes, provided that the interaction is dominated by an identity component.},

However, quantum theory offers genuine nonclassical forms of energy, different from heat, which so far have not been exploited in cyclic engines to produce useful work. We here experimentally realize a novel quantum many-body engine fuelled by the energy difference between fermionic and bosonic ensembles of ultracold particles that follows from the Pauli exclusion principle. We employ a harmonically trapped superfluid gas of \${\textasciicircum}6\$Li atoms close to a magnetic Feshbach resonance which allows us to effectively change the quantum statistics from Bose-Einstein to Fermi-Dirac. We replace the traditional heating and cooling strokes of a quantum Otto cycle by tuning the gas between a Bose- Einstein condensate of bosonic molecules and a unitary Fermi gas (and back) through a magnetic field. The quantum nature of such a Pauli engine is revealed by contrasting it to a classical thermal engine and to a purely interaction-driven device. We obtain a work output of several \$10{\textasciicircum}6\$ vibrational quanta per cycle with an efficiency of up to \$25{\textbackslash}\%\$. Our findings establish quantum statistics as a useful thermodynamic resource for work production, shifting the paradigm of energy-conversion devices to a new class of emergent quantum engines.},

We derive versions of this result for integrated EP incurred over the course of a process, for trajectory-level fluctuating EP, and for instantaneous EP rate. We also show that mismatch cost for fluctuating EP obeys an integral fluctuation theorem. Our results demonstrate a fundamental relationship between "thermodynamic irreversibility" (generation of EP) and "logical irreversibility" (inability to know the initial state corresponding to a given final state). We use this relationship to derive quantitative bounds on the thermodynamics of quantum error correction and to propose a thermodynamically-operationalized measure of the logical irreversibility of a quantum channel. Our results hold for both finite and infinite dimensional systems, and generalize beyond EP to many other thermodynamic costs, including nonadiabatic EP, free energy loss, and entropy gain.},

  abstract = {In an idealistic setting, quantum metrology protocols allow to sense physical parameters with mean squared error that scales as \$1/N{\textasciicircum}2\$ with the number of particles involved---substantially surpassing the \$1/N\$-scaling characteristic to classical statistics. A natural question arises, whether such an impressive enhancement persists when one takes into account the decoherence effects that are unavoidable in any real-life implementation. In this thesis, we resolve a major part of this issue by describing general techniques that allow to quantify the attainable precision in metrological schemes in the presence of uncorrelated noise. We show that the abstract geometrical structure of a quantum channel describing the noisy evolution of a single particle dictates then critical bounds on the ultimate quantum enhancement. Our results prove that an infinitesimal amount of noise is enough to restrict the precision to scale classically in the asymptotic \$N\$ limit, and thus constrain the maximal improvement to a constant factor. Although for low numbers of particles the decoherence may be ignored, for large \$N\$ the presence of noise heavily alters the form of both optimal states and measurements attaining the ultimate resolution. However, the established bounds are then typically achievable with use of techniques natural to current experiments. In this work, we thoroughly introduce the necessary concepts and mathematical tools lying behind metrological tasks, including both frequentist and Bayesian estimation theory frameworks. We provide examples of applications of the methods presented to typical qubit noise models, yet we also discuss in detail the phase estimation tasks in Mach-Zehnder interferometry both in the classical and quantum setting---with particular emphasis given to photonic losses while analysing the impact of decoherence.},

  abstract = {Quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) is a promising tool to prepare thermal or ground states of Hamiltonians, as convergence is guaranteed when the evolved state overlaps with the ground state. However, its implementation using a a hybrid quantum/classical approach, where the dynamics of the parameters of the quantum circuit are derived by McLachlan's variational principle is impractical as the number of parameters \$m\$ increases, since each step in the evolution takes \${\textbackslash}Theta(m{\textasciicircum}2)\$ state preparations to calculate the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM). In this work, we accelerate QITE by rapid estimation of the QFIM, while conserving the convergence guarantees to the extent possible. To this end, we prove that if a parameterized state is rotated by a 2-design and measured in the computational basis, then the QFIM can be inferred from partial derivative cross correlations of the probability outcomes. One sample estimate costs only \${\textbackslash}Theta(m)\$ state preparations, leading to rapid QFIM estimation when a few samples suffice. The second family of estimators take greater liberties and replace QFIMs with averaged classical Fisher information matrices (CFIMs). In an extreme special case optimized for rapid (over accurate) descent, just one CFIM sample is drawn. We justify the second estimator family by proving rapid descent. Guided by these results, we propose the random-measurement imaginary-time evolution (RMITE) algorithm, which we showcase and test in several molecular systems, with the goal of preparing ground states.},

By considering both local and global master equations, we illustrate an enhancement in the performance of the refrigerators with an increase in the spin dimension irrespective of the choice of the spin models. To assess the performance of the refrigerators, we introduce a distance-based measure to quantify the local temperature of a particle with arbitrary spin quantum number j. Interestingly, we find that the local temperature quantifier, defined via minimizing the distance between a spin-j thermal state and the evolved state of the spin-j particle in the steady state, coincides with the population-based definition of local temperature known in the literature for spin-1/2 particles. Moreover, we demonstrate that the qualitative behavior of the distance-based local temperature is independent of the choice of the distance measure by comparing the trace distance, Uhlmann's fidelity and relative entropy distance. We further observe by computing local master equation that the quantum refrigerator consisting of a spin-1/2 and a spin-j particle can lead to a lower local temperature compared to a refrigerator with two identical spin-j particles following the XYZ interactions.},

The scheme employs Newton series rather than Taylor series known from differential calculus, and also works in cases where the Taylor expansion fails. For a function of number operators, such an expansion is automatically normal ordered. Applied to the Holstein-Primakoff representation of spins, the scheme yields an exact series expansion with a finite number of terms and, in addition, allows for a systematic expansion of the spin operators that respects the spin commutation relations within a truncated part of the full Hilbert space. Furthermore, the Newton series expansion strongly facilitates the calculation of expectation values with respect to coherent states. As a third example, we show that factorial moments and factorial cumulants arising in the context of photon or electron counting are a natural consequence of Newton series expansions. Finally, we elucidate the connection between normal ordering, Taylor and Newton series by determining a corresponding integral transformation, which is related to the Mellin transform.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a set of guiding principles for responsible quantum innovation. The principles are organized into three functional categories: safeguarding, engaging, and advancing (SEA), and are linked to central values in responsible research and innovation (RRI). Utilizing a global equity normative framework and literature-based methodology, we connect the quantum-SEA categories to promise and perils specific to quantum technology (QT). The paper operationalizes the responsible QT framework by proposing ten actionable principles to help address the risks, challenges, and opportunities associated with the entire suite of second-generation QTs, which includes the quantum computing, sensing, simulation, and networking domains. Each quantum domain has different technology readiness levels, risks, and affordances, with sensing and simulation arguably being closest to market entrance. Our proposal aims to catalyze a much-needed interdisciplinary effort within the quantum community to establish a foundation of quantum-specific and quantum-tailored principles for responsible quantum innovation. The overarching objective of this interdisciplinary effort is to steer the development and use of QT in a direction not only consistent with a values-based society but also a direction that contributes to addressing some of society's most pressing needs and goals.},

  abstract = {Quantum thermodynamics supplies a consistent description of quantum heat engines and refrigerators up to the level of a single few level system coupled to the environment. Once the environment is split into three;a hot, cold and work reservoirs a heat engine can operate. The device converts the positive gain into power;where the gain is obtained from population inversion between the components of the device. Reversing the operation transforms the device into a quantum refrigerator. The quantum tricycle, a device connected by three external leads to three heat reservoirs is used as a template for engines and refrigerators. The equation of motion for the heat currents and power can be derived from first principle. Only a global description of the coupling of the device to the reservoirs is consistent with the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Optimisation of the devices leads to a balanced set of parameters where the couplings to the three reservoirs are of the same order and the external driving field is in resonance. When analysing refrigerators special attention is devoted to a dynamical version of the third law of thermodynamics. Bounds on the rate of cooling when approaching the absolute zero are obtained by optimising the cooling current. At low temperature all refrigerators show universal behavior. Restrictions on the system imposed by the dynamical version of the third law are studied.},

  abstract = {In the past few decades, numerous heat conduction models extending beyond Fourier's have been developed to account for large gradients, fast phenomena, wave propagation, and heterogeneous material structures typical of biological systems, superlattices, and thermal metamaterials. Navigating through these models has become challenging due to their varying thermodynamic backgrounds and potential compatibility issues. Furthermore, recent discoveries in the field of non-Fourier heat conduction have complicated the interpretation and utilization of specific non-Fourier heat equations, especially when designing materials for the new generation of thermal metamaterials. The situation is further compounded by the existence of numerous modeling strategies in the literature, each offering different interpretations of even the same heat equation. This complexity makes it increasingly difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of this research field. Therefore, this review aims to facilitate the navigation of advanced heat equations beyond Fourier by discussing their properties and potential practical applications in the context of experiments. We begin with the simplest models and their fundamental principles, progressing toward more complex, coupled phenomena, such as ballistic heat conduction. We do not delve into the often intricate technical details of each thermodynamic framework or aim to compare each approach from a methodological perspective. Instead, we focus on reviewing models primarily from the Rational Extended Thermodynamics, Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics, and Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics with Internal Variables frameworks. Additionally, we discuss relevant models from kinetic theory, fractional derivatives, thermomass, and phase lag approaches. We provide background information on these models to highlight their origins, any limitations they may have, and the corresponding stability conditions, if applicable. Furthermore, as the field of non-Fourier heat conduction has become quite segmented, this paper also seeks to establish a common foundation, promoting a comprehensive mutual understanding of the fundamentals of each model and the phenomena to which they can be applied.},

  abstract = {Quantum simulators have recently enabled experimental observations of quantum many-body systems' internal thermalization. Often, the global energy and particle number are conserved, and the system is prepared with a well-defined particle number - in a microcanonical subspace. However, quantum evolution can also conserve quantities, or charges, that fail to commute with each other. Noncommuting charges have recently emerged as a subfield at the intersection of quantum thermodynamics and quantum information. Until now, this subfield has remained theoretical. We initiate the experimental testing of its predictions, with a trapped-ion simulator. We prepare 6-21 spins in an approximate microcanonical subspace, a generalization of the microcanonical subspace for accommodating noncommuting charges, which cannot necessarily have well-defined nontrivial values simultaneously. We simulate a Heisenberg evolution using laser-induced entangling interactions and collective spin rotations. The noncommuting charges are the three spin components. We find that small subsystems equilibrate to near a recently predicted non-Abelian thermal state. This work bridges quantum many-body simulators to the quantum thermodynamics of noncommuting charges, whose predictions can now be tested.},

  abstract = {A longstanding goal in quantum information science is to demonstrate quantum computations that cannot be feasibly reproduced on a classical computer. Such demonstrations mark major milestones: they showcase fine control over quantum systems and are prerequisites for useful quantum computation. To date, quantum advantage has been demonstrated, for example, through violations of Bell inequalities and sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments. However, both forms of advantage come with important caveats: Bell tests are not computationally difficult tasks, and the classical hardness of sampling experiments relies on unproven complexity-theoretic assumptions. Here we demonstrate an unconditional quantum advantage in information resources required for a computational task, realized on Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer operating at a median two-qubit partial-entangler fidelity of 99.941(7)\%. We construct a task for which the most space-efficient classical algorithm provably requires between 62 and 382 bits of memory, and solve it using only 12 qubits. Our result provides the most direct evidence yet that currently existing quantum processors can generate and manipulate entangled states of sufficient complexity to access the exponentiality of Hilbert space. This form of quantum advantage -- which we call quantum information supremacy -- represents a new benchmark in quantum computing, one that does not rely on unproven conjectures.},

Quantum mutual information for bipartite quantum systems is non-negative, and bears the interpretation of total correlation between the two subsystems. This may, however, no longer be true for three or more party quantum systems. In this paper, we propose an alternative definition of multipartite information taking into account the shared information between two and more parties. It is non-negative, observes monotonicity under partial trace as well as completely positive maps, and equals multipartite information measure in literature for pure states. We then define multiparty quantum discord, and give some examples. Interestingly, we observe that quantum discord increases when measurement is performed on a large number of subsystems. Consequently, the symmetric quantum discord, which involves measurement on all parties, reveals the maximal quantumness. This raises question on the interpretation of measured mutual information as classical correlation.}

In contrast to previously known bounds, the obtained bound can be saturated by experimentally feasible situations using the quantum Kalman filter with a large feedback gain, where the cooling efficiency approaches its maximum.

In this Letter, we present the WAY theorem for possibly unbounded and continuous conserved observables under the Yanase condition, which requires that the probe positive operator-valued measure should commute with the conserved observable of the probe system. As a result of this WAY theorem, we show that exact implementations of the projective measurement of the position under momentum conservation and of the quadrature amplitude using linear optical instruments and photon counters are impossible. We also consider implementations of unitary channels under conservation laws and find that the conserved observable LS of the system commutes with the implemented unitary US if LS is semibounded, while U{\dag}SLSUS can shift up to possibly nonzero constant factor if the spectrum of LS is upper and lower unbounded. We give simple examples of the latter case, where LS is a momentum operator.},

  abstract = {Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley-Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay concerning distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been established for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement is corroborated to exist by the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the `entanglement Hamiltonian' or `Hamiltonian of mean force.' As one outcome of our analyses, we enhance the prior clustering theorem concerning bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.},

  abstract = {We establish the general framework of quantum fluctuation theorems by finding the symmetry between the forward and backward transitions of any given quantum channel. The Petz recovery map is adopted as the reverse quantum channel, and the notion of entropy production in thermodynamics is extended to the quantum regime. Our result shows that the fluctuation theorems, which are normally considered for thermodynamic processes, can be a powerful tool to study the detailed statistics of quantum systems as well as the effect of coherence transfer in an arbitrary non-equilibrium quantum process. We introduce a complex-valued entropy production to fully understand the relation between the forward and backward processes through the quantum channel. We find the physical meaning of the imaginary part of entropy production to witness the broken symmetry of the quantum channel. We also show that the imaginary part plays a crucial role in deriving the second law from the quantum fluctuation theorem. The dissipation and fluctuation of various quantum resources including quantum free energy, asymmetry and entanglement can be coherently understood in our unified framework. Our fluctuation theorem can be applied to a wide range of physical systems and dynamics to query the reversibility of a quantum state for the given quantum processing channel involving coherence and entanglement.},

  abstract = {An important issue in developing quantum technology is that quantum states are so sensitive to noise. We propose a protocol that introduces reverse dynamics, in order to precisely control quantum systems against noise described by the Lindblad master equation. The reverse dynamics can be obtained by constructing the Petz recovery map in continuous time. By providing the exact form of the Hamiltonian and jump operators for the reverse dynamics, we explore the potential of utilizing the near-optimal recovery of the Petz map in controlling noisy quantum dynamics. While time-dependent dissipation engineering enables us to fully recover a single quantum trajectory, we also design a time-independent recovery protocol to protect encoded quantum information against decoherence. Our protocol can efficiently suppress only the noise part of dynamics thereby providing an effective unitary evolution of the quantum system.}

The problem of distinguishing state preparation (SPAM) errors from measurement errors is important to the field of characterizing quantum processors. In this work, we propose a method to separately characterize SPAM errors using a novel type of algorithmic cooling protocol called measurement-based algorithmic cooling (MBAC). MBAC assumes the ability to perform (potentially imperfect) projective measurements on individual qubits, which is available on many modern quantum processors. We demonstrate that MBAC can significantly reduce state preparation error under realistic assumptions, with a small overhead that can be upper bounded by measurable quantities. Thus, MBAC can be a valuable tool not only for benchmarking near-term quantum processors, but also for improving the performance of quantum processors in an algorithmic manner.},

  abstract = {Quantum computers have the potential to provide an advantage over classical computers in a number of areas. Numerous metrics to benchmark the performance of quantum computers, ranging from their individual hardware components to entire applications, have been proposed over the years. Navigating the resulting extensive literature can be overwhelming. Objective comparisons are further hampered in practice as different variations of the same metric are used, and the data disclosed together with a reported metric value is often not sufficient to reproduce the measurements. This article addresses these challenges by providing a review of metrics and benchmarks for quantum computers and 1) a comprehensive collection of benchmarks allowing holistic comparisons of quantum computers, 2) a consistent format of the definitions across all metrics including a transparent description of the methodology and of the main assumptions and limitations, and 3) a reproducible approach by linking the metrics to open-source software used to evaluate them. We identify five areas where international standardization working groups could be established, namely: i) the identification and agreement on the categories of metrics that comprehensively benchmark device performance; ii) the identification and agreement on a set of well-established metrics that together comprehensively benchmark performance; iii) the identification of metrics specific to hardware platforms, including non-gate-based quantum computers; iv) inter-laboratory comparison studies to develop best practice guides for measurement methodology; and v) agreement on what data and software should be reported together with a metric value to ensure trust, transparency and reproducibility. We provide potential routes to advancing these areas. We expect this compendium to accelerate the progress of quantum computing hardware towards quantum advantage.},

  abstract = {Recently, geometrical aspects of quantum information have attracted considerable attention due to their applicability in promising new quantum technologies. In particular, the quantum Fisher information has gained prominence for its utility within the field of quantum sensing through the Cram{\textbackslash}'er-Rao bound. Closely related concepts, such as quantum variance and co-variance, fidelity susceptibility, entanglement entropy and Berry curvature have also been extensively studied. While classical information geometry has been developed as a sub-field of mathematical statistics since the late 1950s, it has had a more limited impact within the field of condensed matter physics. Despite this, the generalization of information geometry to incorporate quantum mechanics provides a natural framework for understanding all the above concepts in a unified manner. Starting from an introduction to classical information geometry and Shannon information, we discuss the difficulties in generalizing the classical results to the quantum case and present a pedagogical guide to quantum information geometry. Rather than a thorough review of the by now extensive literature, the intention is to emphasize the unifying framework relating the different concepts and to discuss their applicability to quantum sensing, as well as to the detection of quantum criticality via fidelity susceptibility, and to the understanding of topological properties of ground state manifolds. General relations between the quantum Fisher information and response functions are derived, and scaling relations are discussed, along with bounds relevant to quantum enhanced metrology. Several examples are given for simple one and two qubit systems.},

Not only does this determine the ultimate performance of entanglement testing, but it also establishes the reversibility of all quantum resource theories under asymptotically resource non-generating operations, with the regularised relative entropy of resource governing the asymptotic transformation rate between any two quantum states. As a by-product, we prove that the same Stein exponent can also be achieved when the null hypothesis is only approximately i.i.d., in the sense that it can be modelled by an 'almost power state'. To solve the problem we introduce two techniques. The first is a procedure that we call 'blurring', which, informally, transforms a permutationally symmetric state by making it more evenly spread across nearby type classes. Blurring alone suffices to prove the generalised Stein's lemma in the fully classical case, but not in the quantum case. Our second technical innovation, therefore, is to perform a second quantisation step to lift the problem to an infinite-dimensional bosonic quantum system; we then solve it there by using techniques from continuous-variable quantum information. Rather remarkably, the second-quantised action of the blurring map corresponds to a pure loss channel. A careful examination of this second quantisation step is the core of our quantum solution.},

In this paper we strengthen this connection further by carrying out a complete assessment of the thermodynamic properties of 4-strokes operator-based error correcting codes. This includes an expression for the entropy production in the cycle which, as we show, contains clear contributions stemming from the different sources of irreversibility. To illustrate our results, we study a classical 3-qubit error correcting code, well suited for incoherent states, and the 9-qubit Shor code capable of handling fully quantum states. We show that the work cost associated with the correction gate is directly associated with the heat introduced by the error. Moreover, the work cost associated with encoding/decoding quantum information is always positive, a fact which is related to the intrinsic irreversibility introduced by the noise. Finally, we find that correcting the coherent (and thus genuinely quantum) part of a quantum state introduces substantial modifications related to the Hadamard gates required to encode and decode coherences.},

It is intimately tied with the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, embodying a tool to extend thermodynamic considerations all the way to non-equilibrium processes. It is also often used in attempts to provide the quantitative characterization of logical and thermodynamic irreversibility, stemming from processes in physics, chemistry and biology. Notwithstanding its fundamental character, a unifying theory of entropy production valid for general processes, both classical and quantum, has not yet been formulated. Developments pivoting around the frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, open quantum systems, and quantum information theory have led to substantial progress in such endeavour. This has culminated in the unlocking of a new generation of experiments able to address stochastic thermodynamic processes and the impact of entropy production on them. This paper aims to provide a compendium on the current framework for the description, assessment and manipulation of entropy production. We present both formal aspects of its formulation and the implications stemming from the potential quantum nature of a given process, including a detailed survey of recent experiments.}

The Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation method is particularly suited for dealing with these problems, since it casts the perturbation expansion in terms of operator corrections to a Hamiltonian, which is more intuitive than energy level corrections, as in traditional time-independent perturbation theory. However, the method lacks a systematic approach.\% and has largely remained a niche topic. In these notes we discuss how {\textbackslash}emph\{eigenoperator decompositions\}, a concept largely used in open quantum systems, can be employed to construct an intuitive and systematic formulation of Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory. To illustrate this we revisit various papers in the literature, old and new, and show how they can instead be solved using eigenoperators. Particular emphasis is given to perturbations that couple two systems with very different transition frequencies (highly off-resonance), leading to the so-called dispersive interactions.},

Three approaches are discussed: traditional Euclidean Matsubara, and two recently developed real-time methods, namely, Minkowskian time-path and thermo field dynamics. The first two formulations are derived in a unified manner from the path-integral representation for the contour-ordered generating functional. Fields with spin and gauge fields, in particular, are included. Zero-temperature renormalizability id shown to imply UV finiteness at any temperature and density. Thermo field dynamics, which is basically an operator theory, is presented in a C{$\ast$}-algebraic context. Relevant parts of the HHW formalism of quantum statistical mechanics, and the Tomita-Takesaki theory are explained. The next chapter contains an analysis of the structure and analytic properties of the self-energy and its relation to the full propagator. In this connection the concept of a statistical quasiparticle is briefly described. This is followed by a discussion of thermal WT identities, Results are applied to discuss transversality of the SU(N) gluon polarization tensor. The final chapter deals with the diagrammatic rules for evaluating the pressure and energy density. The energy-momentum tensor is analyzed as a composite operator, and a renormalized virial theorem is established to provide the link with the thermodynamic potential. The pressure of the SU(N) chromoplasma is calculated up to third order.}

  abstract = {Beginning with Anderson (1972), spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in infinite quantum systems is often put forward as an example of (asymptotic) emergence in physics, since in theory no finite system should display it. Even the correspondence between theory and reality is at stake here, since numerous real materials show SSB in their ground states (or equilibrium states at low temperature), although they are finite. Thus against what is sometimes called `Earman's Principle', a genuine physical effect (viz. SSB) seems theoretically recovered only in some idealization (namely the thermodynamic limit), disappearing as soon as the the idealization is removed. We review the well-known arguments that (at first sight) no finite system can exhibit SSB, using the formalism of algebraic quantum theory in order to control the thermodynamic limit and unify the description of finite- and infinite-volume systems. Using the striking mathematical analogy between the thermodynamic limit and the classical limit, we show that a similar situation obtains in quantum mechanics (which typically forbids SSB) versus classical mechanics (which allows it). This discrepancy between formalism and reality is quite similar to the measurement problem, and hence we address it in the same way, adapting an argument of the author and Reuvers (2013) that was originally intended to explain the collapse of the wave-function within conventional quantum mechanics. Namely, exponential sensitivity to (asymmetric) perturbations of the (symmetric) dynamics as the system size increases causes symmetry breaking already in finite but very large quantum systems. This provides continuity between finite- and infinite-volume descriptions of quantum systems featuring SSB and hence restores Earman's Principle (at least in this particularly threatening case).},

  abstract = {It is generally believed that the design of cooling protocols requires knowledge of the system's spectrum. In contrast, cooling processes in nature occur whenever the system is coupled to a cold bath. But how does nature know how to cool quantum systems? Here we address this question by mimicking a natural cold bath with a reservoir of "meter" qubits that are initialized in their ground state and interact with the system sequentially for a specified time before being discarded. This protocol is equivalent to quantum measurements without keeping the measurement readouts. We show that a quantum system can be cooled without prior knowledge of the system's details when the interactions between the system and the meters, as well as the level splittings of the meters, are chosen randomly. For sufficiently small interaction strengths and long interaction times, the rotating-wave approximation becomes valid, ensuring that resonant energy-exchange processes, which lead to cooling, dominate over heating. This demonstrates that robust and scalable cooling of complex quantum systems can be achieved through generic, structure-independent protocols. Our findings thus offer a versatile universal framework for engineering, controlling, and manipulating quantum matter far from equilibrium, in particular, for the purposes of quantum information processing and quantum simulations.},

  abstract = {The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model has been at the forefront of quantum optics for almost six decades to date, providing one of the simplest yet intricately nonlinear formulations of light-matter interaction in modern physics. Laying most of the emphasis on the omnipresence of the model across a range of disciplines, this monograph brings up the fundamental generality of its formalism, looking at a wide gamut of applications in specific physical systems among several realms, including atomic physics, quantum optics, solid-state physics and quantum information science. When bringing the various pieces together to assemble our narrative, we have primarily targeted researchers in quantum physics and quantum optics. The monograph also comprises an accessible introduction for graduate students engaged with non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions, quantum computing and simulation, and quantum many-body physics. In that framework, we aim to reveal the common ground between physics and applications scattered across literature and different technological advancements. The exposition guides the reader through a vibrant field interlacing quantum optics and condensed-matter physics. All sections are devoted to the strong interconnection between theory and experiment, historically linked to the development of the various modern research directions stemming from JC physics. This is accompanied by a comprehensive list of references to the key publications that have shaped its evolution since the early 1960s. Finally, we have endeavored to keep the presentation of such a multi-sided material as concise as possible, interspersing continuous text with various illustrations alongside an economical use of mathematical expressions.},

  abstract = {According to the classical nineteenth century worldview, physical systems followed precisely defined trajectories that evolved according to deterministic laws. Physical theory was causally closed, having no place for interventions into its unfolding. Early in the twentieth century, this classical picture was overturned by a new fundamental physical theory. Unlike its classical predecessor, quantum theory is stochastic and causally open. Quantum theory represents not only the passive evolution of closed physical systems, but also the effects of interventions. According to quantum theory, the behavior of a quantum system in response to interventions is intrinsically unpredictable and follows a stochastic law. Stochastic theories of the effects of interventions have become popular recently in artificial intelligence. In these theories, the behavior of an undisturbed system is represented as a graph in which nodes represent variables and directed arcs represent cause and effect relationships. A causal theory specifies both the behavior of the undisturbed system and how it responds to interventions. Interventions act as local surgery to cut the causal links into one or more manipulated variables, and to set the manipulated variables to values specified from outside the model. This paper describes quantum theory as a theory of the effects of interventions, relates it to currently popular theories of causality, and formalizes quantum evolution in terms of graphical probability models defined on density operators.

We find that the precision of the temperature estimation is largely increased at high temperatures, reaching even the Heisenberg scaling - inversely proportional to the number of spins. For Otto engines operating close to the Carnot efficiency, collective coupling always enhances the output power. Some tangible experimental platforms are suggested.},

  abstract = {The formalism of quantum estimation theory with a specific focus on classical data postprocessing is applied to a two-level system driven by an external gyrating magnetic field. We employed both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to estimate the unknown transition frequency. In the frequentist approach, we have shown that only reducing the distance between the classical and the quantum Fisher information does not necessarily mean that the estimators as functions of the data deliver an estimate with desirable accuracy, as the classical Fisher information takes small values. We have proposed and investigated a cost function to account for the maximization of the classical Fisher information and the minimization of the aforementioned distance. Due to the nonlinearity of the probability mass function of the data on the transition frequency, the minimum variance unbiased estimator may not exist. The maximum likelihood and the maximum a posteriori estimators often result in ambiguous estimates, which in certain cases can be made unambiguous upon changing the parameters of the external field. It is demonstrated that the minimum mean-square error estimator of the Bayesian statistics provides unambiguous estimates. In the Bayesian approach, we have also investigated the effects of noninformative and informative priors on the Bayesian estimates, including a uniform prior, Jeffrey's prior, and a Gaussian prior.},

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

It is primarily an extended account of results obtained over the last four years by the authors; while they try to provide some background for orientation, it is emphatically not intended as a comprehensive review of the literature on the subject. Its contents include (1) an exact and general prescription for the reduction, under appropriate circumstances, of the problem of a system tunneling between two wells in the presence of a dissipative environment to the "spin-boson" problem; (2) the derivation of an exact formula for the dynamics of the latter problem; (3) the demonstration that there exists a simple approximation to this exact formula which is controlled, in the sense that we can put explicit bounds on the errors incurred in it, and that for almost all regions of the parameter space these errors are either very small in the limit of interest to us (the "slow-tunneling" limit) or can themselves be evaluated with satisfactory accuracy; (4) use of these results to obtain quantitative expressions for the dynamics of the system as a function of the spectral density {$J$}⁡({$\omega$}) of its coupling to the environment. If {$J$}⁡({$\omega$}) behaves as {$\omegas$} for frequencies of the order of the tunneling frequency or smaller, the authors find for the "unbiased" case the following results: For {$s<$}1 the system is localized at zero temperature, and at finite {$T$} relaxes incoherently at a rate proportional to exp-({$T$}0{$T$})1-{$s$}. For {$s>$}2 it undergoes underdamped coherent oscillations for all relevant temperatures, while for 1{$<s<$}2 there is a crossover from coherent oscillation to overdamped relaxation as {$T$} increases. Exact expressions for the oscillation and/or relaxation rates are presented in all these cases. For the "ohmic" case, {$s$}=1, the qualitative nature of the behavior depends critically on the dimensionless coupling strength {$A$} as well as the temperature {$T$}: over most of the ({$A$},{$T$}) plane (including the whole region {$A>$}1) the behavior is an incoherent relaxation at a rate proportional to {$T$}2⁢{$A-$}1, but for low {$T$} and 0{$<A<$}12 the authors predict a combination of damped coherent oscillation and incoherent background which appears to disagree with the results of all previous approximations. The case of finite bias is also discussed.}

  abstract = {Quantum theory can be viewed as a generalization of classical probability theory, but the analogy as it has been developed so far is not complete. Whereas the manner in which inferences are made in classical probability theory is independent of the causal relation that holds between the conditioned variable and the conditioning variable, in the conventional quantum formalism, there is a significant difference between how one treats experiments involving two systems at a single time and those involving a single system at two times. In this article, we develop the formalism of quantum conditional states, which provides a unified description of these two sorts of experiment. In addition, concepts that are distinct in the conventional formalism become unified: channels, sets of states, and positive operator valued measures are all seen to be instances of conditional states; the action of a channel on a state, ensemble averaging, the Born rule, the composition of channels, and nonselective state-update rules are all seen to be instances of belief propagation. Using a quantum generalization of Bayes' theorem and the associated notion of Bayesian conditioning, we also show that the remote steering of quantum states can be described within our formalism as a mere updating of beliefs about one system given new information about another, and retrodictive inferences can be expressed using the same belief propagation rule as is used for predictive inferences. Finally, we show that previous arguments for interpreting the projection postulate as a quantum generalization of Bayesian conditioning are based on a misleading analogy and that it is best understood as a combination of belief propagation (corresponding to the nonselective state-update map) and conditioning on the measurement outcome.},

  abstract = {Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.},

  abstract = {The concept of a supersolid state combines the crystallization of a many-body system with dissipationless flow of the atoms from which it is built. This quantum phase requires the breaking of two continuous symmetries: the phase invariance of a superfluid and the continuous translational invariance to form the crystal. Despite having been proposed for helium almost 50 years ago, experimental verification of supersolidity remains elusive. A variant with only discrete translational symmetry breaking on a preimposed lattice structure - the 'lattice supersolid' - has been realized, based on self-organization of a Bose-Einstein condensate. However, lattice supersolids do not feature the continuous ground-state degeneracy that characterizes the supersolid state as originally proposed. Here we report the realization of a supersolid with continuous translational symmetry breaking along one direction in a quantum gas. The continuous symmetry that is broken emerges from two discrete spatial symmetries by symmetrically coupling a Bose-Einstein condensate to the modes of two optical cavities. We establish the phase coherence of the supersolid and find a high ground-state degeneracy by measuring the crystal position over many realizations through the light fields that leak from the cavities. These light fields are also used to monitor the position fluctuations in real time. Our concept provides a route to creating and studying glassy many-body systems with controllably lifted ground-state degeneracies, such as supersolids in the presence of disorder.}

On the experimental side the impressive developments on the manipulation of neutral atoms and trapped ions are providing new capabilities to probe their quantum dynamics. Here, we overview and discuss progress in characterizing and understanding the dynamics of quantum entanglement and information scrambling in quantum many-body systems. The level of control attainable over both the internal and external degrees of freedom of individual particles in these systems provides great insight into the intrinsic connection between entanglement and thermodynamics, bounds on information transport and computational complexity of interacting systems. In turn this understanding should enable the realization of quantum technologies.},

  abstract = {Markovian approximation is a widely-employed idea in descriptions of the dynamics of open quantum systems (OQSs). Although it is usually claimed to be a concept inspired by classical Markovianity, the term quantum Markovianity is used inconsistently and often unrigorously in the literature. In this report we compare the descriptions of classical stochastic processes and quantum stochastic processes (as arising in OQSs), and show that there are inherent differences that lead to the non-trivial problem of characterizing quantum non-Markovianity. Rather than proposing a single definition of quantum Markovianity, we study a host of Markov-related concepts in the quantum regime. Some of these concepts have long been used in quantum theory, such as quantum white noise, factorization approximation, divisibility, Lindblad master equation, etc.. Others are first proposed in this report, including those we call past-future independence, no (quantum) information backflow, and composability. All of these concepts are defined under a unified framework, which allows us to rigorously build hierarchy relations among them. With various examples, we argue that the current most often used definitions of quantum Markovianity in the literature do not fully capture the memoryless property of OQSs. In fact, quantum non-Markovianity is highly context-dependent. The results in this report, summarized as a hierarchy figure, bring clarity to the nature of quantum non-Markovianity.},

A large number of different proposals exist. In this review, we summarize the required properties of a quantum fidelity measure, and compare them, to determine which properties each of the different measures has. We show that there are large classes of measures that satisfy all the required properties of a fidelity measure, just as there are many norms of Hilbert space operators, and many measures of entropy. We compare these fidelities, with detailed proofs of their properties. We also summarize briefly the applications of these measures in teleportation, quantum memories, quantum computers, quantum communications, and quantum phase-space simulations.},

In practice, the achievable distance for QKD has been limited to a few hundred kilometers, due to the channel loss of fibers or terrestrial free space that exponentially reduced the photon rate. Satellite-based QKD promises to establish a global-scale quantum network by exploiting the negligible photon loss and decoherence in the empty out space. Here, we develop and launch a low-Earth-orbit satellite to implement decoy-state QKD with over kHz key rate from the satellite to ground over a distance up to 1200 km, which is up to 20 orders of magnitudes more efficient than that expected using an optical fiber (with 0.2 dB/km loss) of the same length. The establishment of a reliable and efficient space-to-ground link for faithful quantum state transmission constitutes a key milestone for global-scale quantum networks.},

We show that the dynamics can reflect the phase transition of the Rabi model. In addition to the excitation of the qubit and bosonic field in the ground state, we show that the witness of inseparability, mutual information, quantum Fisher information, and the variance of cavity quadrature can be employed to detect the phase transition in quench. We also reveal the negative impact of temperature on checking the phase transition by quench. This model can be implemented using trapped ions, where the coupling strength can be flexibly adjusted from weak to ultrastrong regime. By reflecting the phase transition in a fundamental quantum optics model without imposing the thermodynamic limit, we propose a method to explore phase transition in non-equilibrium process.},

  abstract = {Establishing a notion of the quantum state that applies consistently across space and time is a crucial step toward formulating a relativistic quantum theory. We give an operational meaning to multipartite quantum states over arbitrary regions in spacetime through the causally agnostic measurement, the measurement scheme that can be consistently implemented independently of the causal relation between the regions. We prove that such measurements can always be implemented with interferometry, wherein the conventional density operator, the recently developed quantum state over time (QSOT), and the process matrix formalisms smoothly merge. This framework allows for a systematic study of mixed states in the temporal setting, which turn out to be crucial for modeling quantum non-Markovianity. Based on this, we demonstrate that two different ensembles of quantum dynamics can be represented by the same QSOT, indicating that they cannot be distinguished through interferometry. Moreover, our formalism reveals a new type of spatiotemporal correlation between two quantum dynamics that originates from synchronized propagation in time under time-reversal symmetry. We show that quantum systems with such correlation can be utilized as a reference frame to distinguish certain dynamics indistinguishable under time-reversal symmetry.},

In other words, they are the only channels that preserve equilibrium between system and environment. Extending this perspective, we explore an information theoretic idealization of heat bath behavior, by considering channels where the environment remains locally invariant for every initial state of the system. These are known as catalytic channels. We show that catalytic channels provide a refined hierarchy of Gibbs-preserving maps for fully-degenerate Hamiltonians, and are closely related to dual unitary quantum circuits.},

One of the main concepts that makes everything work is the comparison principle (which, in essence, states that given any two states of the same chemical composition at least one is adiabatically accessible from the other) and we show that it can be derived from some assumptions about the pressure and thermal equilibrium. Temperature is derived from entropy, but at the start not even the concept of `hotness' is assumed.

  abstract = {Symmetry-breaking transitions are a well-understood phenomenon of closed quantum systems in quantum optics, condensed matter, and high energy physics. However, symmetry breaking in open systems is less thoroughly understood, in part due to the richer steady-state and symmetry structure that such systems possess. For the prototypical open system---a Lindbladian---a unitary symmetry can be imposed in a "weak" or a "strong" way. We characterize the possible \${\textbackslash}backslashmathbb\{Z\}\_n\$ symmetry breaking transitions for both cases. In the case of \${\textbackslash}backslashmathbb\{Z\}\_2\$, a weak-symmetry-broken phase guarantees at most a classical bit steady-state structure, while a strong-symmetry-broken phase admits a partially-protected steady-state qubit. Viewing photonic cat qubits through the lens of strong-symmetry breaking, we show how to dynamically recover the logical information after any gap-preserving strong-symmetric error; such recovery becomes perfect exponentially quickly in the number of photons. Our study forges a connection between driven-dissipative phase transitions and error correction.}

  abstract = {In fault-tolerant quantum computing, quantum algorithms are implemented through quantum circuits capable of error correction. These circuits are typically constructed based on specific quantum error correction codes, with consideration given to the characteristics of the underlying physical platforms. Optimising these circuits within the constraints of today's quantum computing technologies, particularly in terms of error rates, qubit counts, and network topologies, holds substantial implications for the feasibility of quantum applications in the near future. This paper presents a toolkit for designing and analysing fault-tolerant quantum circuits. We introduce a framework for representing stabiliser circuits using classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Each codeword in the representation corresponds to a quantum-mechanical equation regarding the circuit, formalising the correlations utilised in parity checks and delineating logical operations within the circuit. Consequently, the LDPC code provides a means of quantifying fault tolerance and verifying logical operations. We outline the procedure for generating LDPC codes from circuits using the Tanner graph notation, alongside proposing graph-theory tools for constructing fault-tolerant quantum circuits from classical LDPC codes. These findings offer a systematic approach to applying classical error correction techniques in optimising existing fault-tolerant protocols and developing new ones.},

  abstract = {Entanglement is a defining property of quantum systems. For a subsystem of a larger quantum system, one can formally define an operator known as the modular Hamiltonian, which is closely linked to the entanglement properties of that subsystem, and a corresponding operator flow called the modular flow. Algorithms for estimating the von Neumann entropy, the best-known entanglement measure, are well-established, but no equivalent procedures have been previously described for the modular flow. In this work, we briefly review the quantum singular value transform (QSVT) framework for developing quantum algorithms, and then discuss the implementation of modular flow within this framework. We conclude by describing select applications of our modular flow algorithm, such as extracting the chiral central charge of a topologically ordered system and simulating the experience of the bulk observer in holography. We also prove a query complexity lower bound for modular flow, which shows that our method cannot be improved further substantially.},

This can be traced to the fact that a qudit has multiple possible transition channels between its energy levels, in contrast to the 2-level qubit model. We illustrate these limitations using two types of qutrit detector models based on the spin-1 representations of \$SU(2)\$ and the non-Hermitian generalization of the Pauli observables (the Heisenberg-Weyl operators).},

We demonstrate that state-of-the-art EOS experiments enable one to harvest entanglement from the vacuum field and to study quantum correlations within general THz fields. We further show how Bell nonlocality present in the vacuum field can be probed. Finally, we introduce a novel approach to mitigate shot noise in single-beam EOS configurations. These findings pave the way for experimental inquiries into foundational properties of relativistic quantum field theory, and empower EOS as a diagnostic tool in THz quantum optics.},

By contrast, we find that for an ensemble of one-mode Gaussian states based on the Bures measure the corresponding distribution cannot be normalized. As important applications, we determine the distribution and the mean value of von Neumann entropy and purity for the Hilbert-Schmidt measure.}

This work explores a novel perspective by analyzing a broad family of AC protocols from a thermodynamic standpoint. First, we give an in-depth review and formal classification of standard AC protocols. Leveraging the transfer matrix formalism, we achieve a consistent calculation of performance metrics, encompassing both cooling limits and target state evolution. We obtained a unification of these diverse cooling limits into a single, coherent mathematical expression, streamlining comparative analyses. Then, to assess the efficiency of coherent cooling protocols, we introduce two generic metrics: the coefficient of performance \$K\$ and the Landauer Ratio \$R\_L\$, and establish a direct interrelation. Applying these metrics, we thoroughly evaluate selected AC protocols, highlighting their relative strengths. Finally, we propose improved versions of AC protocols that exhibit enhanced thermodynamic performance, achieving desired target temperatures with lower work inputs. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of AC protocols and provides valuable insights for designing efficient cooling strategies in various applications.},

Nevertheless one may wonder if it would be possible to attribute a meaningful notion of temperature to an arbitrary quantum state, beyond simply the thermal (Gibbs) state. In this work, we propose such a notion of temperature considering an operational task, inspired by the Zeroth Law of thermodynamics. Specifically, we define two effective temperatures for quantifying the ability of a quantum system to cool down or heat up a thermal environment. In this way we can associate an operationally meaningful notion of temperature to any quantum density matrix. We provide general expressions for these effective temperatures, for both single- and many-copy systems, establishing connections to concepts previously discussed in the literature. Finally, we consider a more sophisticated scenario where the heat exchange between the system and the thermal environment is assisted by a quantum reference frame. This leads to an effect of "coherent quantum catalysis", where the use of a coherent catalyst allows for exploiting quantum energetic coherences in the system, now leading to much colder or hotter effective temperatures.},

  abstract = {The principle of tomographic locality states that the operational state of a multipartite system can be fully characterized by the statistics obtained from measurements that are local to the individual subsystems. This property holds in quantum theory and features prominently in axiomatic reconstructions of the theory, where it serves to rule out a wide class of alternatives. For instance, quantum theory with Hilbert spaces defined over the real field (rather than the complex field) is an example of a theory that is ruled out in this fashion. Given its foundational importance, it is worthwhile to subject this principle to a direct experimental test. Specifically, we consider an experiment on the polarization degrees of freedom of a pair of photonic modes in a prepare-and-measure scenario and analyze the resulting data within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. The signature of a failure of tomographic locality is that there are pairs of states on the bipartite system that can only be distinguished by the statistics they yield for non-separable measurements. In the full quantum setting, we find no evidence of a violation of tomographic locality. As a test of our analysis method, we also verify that if we restrict attention to those states and measurements that lie within the fragment described by quantum theory over the real field, then a clear signature of the failure of tomographic locality is observed.},

In the second-order phase transition to the superradiant phase, there is a significant suppression of the order parameter and the appearance of non-universal factors, which directly reflect the spin populations. Furthermore, upon entering a parameter regime where mean-field theory predicts a tricritical phase, we find a first-order phase transition due to the unexpected collapse of superradiance. An accurate and physically transparent description going beyond mean-field theory is established by combining exact numerical simulations, the cumulant expansion, and analytical approximations based on reduced master equations and an effective equilibrium theory. Our findings, compared to the conventional thermodynamic limit of the Dicke model, indicate a general tendency of forming extreme non-equilibrium states in the single-spin system, thus have broad implications for dissipative phase transitions of few-body systems.},

  abstract = {We study stabilizer quantum error correcting codes (QECC) generated under hybrid dynamics of local Clifford unitaries and local Pauli measurements in one dimension. Building upon 1) a general formula relating the error-susceptibility of a subregion to its entanglement properties, and 2) a previously established mapping between entanglement entropies and domain wall free energies of an underlying spin model, we propose a statistical mechanical description of the QECC in terms of "entanglement domain walls". Free energies of such domain walls generically feature a leading volume law term coming from its "surface energy", and a sub-volume law correction coming from thermodynamic entropies of its transverse fluctuations. These are most easily accounted for by capillary-wave theory of liquid-gas interfaces, which we use as an illustrative tool. We show that the information-theoretic decoupling criterion corresponds to a geometric decoupling of domain walls, which further leads to the identification of the "contiguous code distance" of the QECC as the crossover length scale at which the energy and entropy of the domain wall are comparable. The contiguous code distance thus diverges with the system size as the subleading entropic term of the free energy, protecting a finite code rate against local undetectable errors. We support these correspondences with numerical evidence, where we find capillary-wave theory describes many qualitative features of the QECC; we also discuss when and why it fails to do so.},

  abstract = {Quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) is a core concept in theoretical quantum metrology due to the significant importance of quantum Cram{\textbackslash}'\{e\}r-Rao bound in quantum parameter estimation. However, studies in recent years have revealed wide connections between QFIM and other aspects of quantum mechanics, including quantum thermodynamics, quantum phase transition, entanglement witness, quantum speed limit and non-Markovianity. These connections indicate that QFIM is more than a concept in quantum metrology, but rather a fundamental quantity in quantum mechanics. In this paper, we summarize the properties and existing calculation techniques of QFIM for various cases, and review the development of QFIM in some aspects of quantum mechanics apart from quantum metrology. On the other hand, as the main application of QFIM, the second part of this paper reviews the quantum multiparameter Cram{\textbackslash}'\{e\}r-Rao bound, its attainability condition and the associated optimal measurements. Moreover, recent developments in a few typical scenarios of quantum multiparameter estimation and the quantum advantages are also thoroughly discussed in this part.},

  abstract = {Quantum error correction (QEC) is a key concept in quantum computation as well as many areas of physics. There are fundamental tensions between continuous symmetries and QEC. One vital situation is unfolded by the Eastin--Knill theorem, which forbids the existence of QEC codes that admit transversal continuous symmetry actions (transformations). Here, we systematically study the competition between continuous symmetries and QEC in a quantitative manner. We first define a series of meaningful measures of approximate symmetries motivated from different perspectives, and then establish a series of trade-off bounds between them and QEC accuracy utilizing multiple different methods. Remarkably, the results allow us to derive general quantitative limitations of transversally implementable logical gates, an important topic in fault-tolerant quantum computation. As concrete examples, we showcase two explicit types of quantum codes, obtained from quantum Reed--Muller codes and thermodynamic codes, respectively, that nearly saturate our bounds. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of our results in physics.},

  abstract = {We systematically study the fundamental competition between quantum error correction (QEC) and continuous symmetries, two key notions in quantum information and physics, in a quantitative manner. Three meaningful measures of approximate symmetries in quantum channels and in particular QEC codes, respectively based on the violation of covariance conditions over the entire symmetry group or at a local point, and the violation of charge conservation, are introduced and studied. Each measure induces a corresponding characterization of approximately covariant codes. We explicate a host of different ideas and techniques that enable us to derive various forms of trade-off relations between the QEC inaccuracy and all symmetry violation measures. More specifically, we introduce two frameworks for understanding and establishing the trade-offs respectively based on the notions of charge fluctuation and gate implementation error, and employ methods including the Knill--Laflamme conditions as well as quantum metrology and quantum resource theory for the derivation. From the perspective of fault-tolerant quantum computing, our bounds on symmetry violation indicate limitations on the precision or density of transversally implementable logical gates for general QEC codes, refining the Eastin--Knill theorem. To exemplify nontrivial approximately covariant codes and understand the achievability of the above fundamental limits, we analyze the behaviors of two explicit types of codes: a parametrized extension of the thermodynamic code (which gives a construction of a code family that continuously interpolates between exact QEC and exact symmetry), and the quantum Reed--Muller codes. We show that both codes can saturate the scaling of the bounds for group-global covariance and charge conservation asymptotically, indicating the near-optimality of these bounds and codes.},

Relaxing the requirement of exact pure output, we further extend our result to establish quantitative sample complexity bounds for approximate purification, independent of any task details or operational constraints. To illustrate the practical consequences of this principle, we examine the task of approximately preparing pure dilation and, for the first time, prove an exponential lower bound on the required sample complexity.},

First, for the quasistatic process, the thermodynamic cost of collective reset is remarkably lower than parallel reset because of the reduced Hilbert space dimension due to entanglement effects. Second, for the finite-time qubit reset, we prove that the error probability fades away and per-qubit heat production tends the Landauer bound for initially continuous protocols in the thermodynamic limit. Third, we show that qubit reset performance enhances with the increase in the number of qubits.

In particular, it is shown that the eigenvalues of the Choi matrix of a unital quantum channel form a complete set of invariants of the canonical form. It follows immediately that every unital qubit channel is the average of four unitary channels. More generally, a unital qubit channel can be expressed as the convex combination of unitary channels with convex coefficients \$p\_1, {\textbackslash}dots, p\_m\$ as long as \$2(p\_1, {\textbackslash}dots, p\_m)\$ is majorized by the vector of eigenvalues of the Choi matrix of the channel.

  abstract = {In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system's minimum energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a semi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space. These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by quantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard (stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for the minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent approach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it can be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at solving SDPs.},

We illustrated the power of this construction by showing that the qualitative behavior of the entanglement entropy for a non-Fermi liquid can be obtained by simple dimensional analysis. We argue that the functional dependence of the ``renormalized entanglement entropy'' on R can be interpreted as describing the renormalization group flow of the entanglement entropy with distance scale. The corresponding quantity for a spherical region in the vacuum, has some particularly interesting properties. For a conformal field theory, it reduces to the previously proposed central charge in all dimensions, and for a general quantum field theory, it interpolates between the central charges of the UV and IR fixed points as R is varied from zero to infinity. We conjecture that in three (spacetime) dimensions, it is always non-negative and monotonic, and provides a measure of the number of degrees of freedom of a system at scale R. In four dimensions, however, we find examples in which it is neither monotonic nor non-negative.},

These different views yield identical density matrices and therefore identical predictions for future measurements. But when used as prior beliefs for inferring the past state from later observations ("retrodiction"), they lead to different updated beliefs. This is a purely quantum feature of Bayesian agency. Based on this observation, we establish a framework for retrodicting on any quantum belief and we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the equivalence of beliefs.

  abstract = {Quantum error mitigation is a key approach for extracting target state properties on state-of-the-art noisy machines and early fault-tolerant devices. Using the ideas from flag fault tolerance and virtual state purification, we develop the virtual channel purification (VCP) protocol, which consumes similar qubit and gate resources as virtual state purification but offers up to exponentially stronger error suppression with increased system size and more noisy operation copies. Furthermore, VCP removes most of the assumptions required in virtual state purification. Essentially, VCP is the first quantum error mitigation protocol that does not require specific knowledge about the noise models, the target quantum state, and the target problem while still offering rigorous performance guarantees for practical noise regimes. Further connections are made between VCP and quantum error correction to produce one of the first protocols that combine quantum error correction and quantum error mitigation beyond concatenation. We can remove all noise in the channel while paying only the same sampling cost as low-order purification, reaching beyond the standard bias-variance trade-off in quantum error mitigation. Our protocol can also be adapted to key tasks in quantum networks like channel capacity activation and entanglement distribution.},

  abstract = {The storage and processing of quantum information are susceptible to external noise, resulting in computational errors that are inherently continuous A powerful method to suppress these effects is to use quantum error correction. Typically, quantum error correction is executed in discrete rounds where errors are digitized and detected by projective multi-qubit parity measurements. These stabilizer measurements are traditionally realized with entangling gates and projective measurement on ancillary qubits to complete a round of error correction. However, their gate structure makes them vulnerable to errors occurring at specific times in the code and errors on the ancilla qubits. Here we use direct parity measurements to implement a continuous quantum bit-flip correction code in a resource-efficient manner, eliminating entangling gates, ancilla qubits, and their associated errors. The continuous measurements are monitored by an FPGA controller that actively corrects errors as they are detected. Using this method, we achieve an average bit-flip detection efficiency of up to 91\%. Furthermore, we use the protocol to increase the relaxation time of the protected logical qubit by a factor of 2.7 over the relaxation times of the bare comprising qubits. Our results showcase resource-efficient stabilizer measurements in a multi-qubit architecture and demonstrate how continuous error correction codes can address challenges in realizing a fault-tolerant system.},

Inspired by quantum computation, we define a set of elementary thermodynamic gates that only act on 2 energy levels of a system at a time. We show that this theory is well reproduced by a Jaynes-Cummings interaction in rotating wave approximation and draw a connection to standard descriptions of thermalisation. We then prove that elementary thermal operations present tighter constraints on the allowed transformations than thermal operations. Mathematically, this illustrates the failure at finite temperature of fundamental theorems by Birkhoff and Muirhead-Hardy-Littlewood-Polya concerning stochastic maps. Physically, this implies that stronger constraints than those imposed by single-shot quantities can be given if we tailor a thermodynamic resource theory to the relevant experimental scenario. We provide new tools to do so, including necessary and sufficient conditions for a given change of the population to be possible. As an example, we describe the resource theory of the Jaynes-Cummings model.

  abstract = {Under certain conditions, it takes a shorter time to cool a hot system than to cool the same system initiated at a lower temperature. This phenomenon - the "Mpemba Effect" - is well known in water, and has recently been observed in other systems as well. However, there is no single generic mechanism that explains this counter-intuitive behavior. Using the theoretical framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we present a widely applicable mechanism for this effect, derive a sufficient condition for its appearance in Markovian dynamics, and predict an inverse Mpemba effect in heating: under proper conditions, a cold system can heat up faster than the same system initiated at a higher temperature. Our results suggest that it should be possible to observe the Mpemba effect and its inverse in a variety of systems, where they have never been demonstrated before.},

All systems belonging to a given universality class have the same critical exponents, and certain scaling functions become identical near the critical point. It is the aim of this work to demonstrate the usefulness of universal scaling functions for the analysis of non-equilibrium phase transitions. In order to limit the coverage of this article, we focus on a particular class of non-equilibrium critical phenomena, the so-called absorbing phase transitions. These phase transitions arise from a competition of opposing processes, usually creation and annihilation processes. The transition point separates an active phase and an absorbing phase in which the dynamics is frozen. A systematic analysis of universal scaling functions of absorbing phase transitions is presented, including static, dynamical, and finite-size scaling measurements. As a result a picture gallery of universal scaling functions is presented which allows to identify and to distinguish universality classes.},

  abstract = {We develop the theory of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) for bipartite quantum systems represented by commuting von Neumann algebras. Our central result is the extension of Nielsen's Theorem, stating that the LOCC ordering of bipartite pure states is equivalent to the majorization of their restrictions, to arbitrary factors. As a consequence, we find that in bipartite system modeled by commuting factors in Haag duality, a) all states have infinite single-shot entanglement if and only if the local factors are not of type I, b) type III factors are characterized by LOCC transitions of arbitrary precision between any two pure states, and c) the latter holds even without classical communication for type III\$\_\{1\}\$ factors. In the case of semifinite factors, the usual construction of pure state entanglement monotones carries over. Together with recent work on embezzlement of entanglement, this gives a one-to-one correspondence between the classification of factors into types and subtypes and operational entanglement properties. In the appendix, we provide a self-contained treatment of majorization on semifinite von Neumann algebras and \${\textbackslash}sigma\$-finite measure spaces.},

Given a shared entangled resource state, this task asks to produce arbitrary entangled states using local operations without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. We quantify the performance of a given resource state by the worst-case error. States for which the latter vanishes are 'embezzling states' as they allow to embezzle arbitrary entangled states with arbitrarily small error. The best and worst performance among all states defines two algebraic invariants for von Neumann algebras. The first invariant takes only two values. Either it vanishes and embezzling states exist, which can only happen in type III, or no state allows for nontrivial embezzlement. In the case of factors not of finite type I, the second invariant equals the diameter of the state space. This provides a quantitative operational interpretation of Connes' classification of type III factors within quantum information theory. Type III\$\_1\$ factors are 'universal embezzlers' where every state is embezzling. Our findings have implications for relativistic quantum field theory, where type III algebras naturally appear. For instance, they explain the maximal violation of Bell inequalities in the vacuum. Our results follow from a one-to-one correspondence between embezzling states and invariant probability measures on the flow of weights. We also establish that universally embezzling ITPFI factors are of type III\$\_1\$ by elementary arguments.},

  abstract = {Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the task of extracting entanglement from an entanglement resource via local operations and without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. Recently, the existence of embezzling states of bipartite systems of type III von Neumann algebras was shown. However, both the multipartite case and the precise relation between embezzling states and the notion of embezzling families, as originally defined by van Dam and Hayden, was left open. Here, we show that finite-dimensional approximations of multipartite embezzling states form multipartite embezzling families. In contrast, not every embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. We identify an additional consistency condition that ensures that an embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. This criterion distinguishes the embezzling family of van Dam and Hayden from the one by Leung, Toner, and Watrous. The latter generalizes to the multipartite setting. By taking a limit, we obtain a multipartite system of commuting type III\$\_1\$ factors on which every state is an embezzling state. We discuss our results in the context of quantum field theory and quantum many-body physics. As open problems, we ask whether vacua of relativistic quantum fields in more than two spacetime dimensions are multipartite embezzling states and whether multipartite embezzlement allows for an operator-algebraic characterization.},

  abstract = {In quantum systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, states can be infinitely entangled across a pair of subsystems, but are there different forms of infinite entanglement? To understand entanglement in such systems, we use a framework in which subsystems are described by von Neumann algebras on the full system's Hilbert space. Although this approach has been known for over 50 years, an operational justification has been missing so far. We resolve this by deriving the von Neumann algebraic description of subsystems from operational axioms. This raises the question of how physical properties of the subsystem relate to algebraic properties. Our main result shows a surprisingly strong connection: The type classification of von Neumann algebras (types I, II, III, and their respective subtypes) is in one-to-one correspondence with a family of operational entanglement properties. For instance, Connes' classification of type III factors can be formulated in terms of the smallest achievable error when "embezzling" entanglement from the system. Our findings promote the type classification from algebraic bookkeeping to a classification of infinite quantum systems based on the kind of infinite entanglement that they support.},

  abstract = {Quantum theory has been successfully validated in numerous laboratory experiments. But would such a theory, which excellently describes the behavior of microscopic physical systems, and its predicted phenomena such as quantum entanglement, be still applicable on very large length scales? From a practical perspective, how can quantum key distribution -- where the security of establishing secret keys between distant parties is ensured by the laws of quantum mechanics -- be made technologically useful on a global scale? Due to photon loss in optical fibers and terrestrial free space, the achievable distance using direct transmission of single photons has been limited to a few hundred kilometers. A promising route to testing quantum physics over long distances and in the relativistic regimes, and thus realizing flexible global-scale quantum networks is via the use of satellites and space-based technologies, where a significant advantage is that the photon loss and turbulence predominantly occurs in the lower {\textasciitilde} 10 km of the atmosphere, and most of the photons' transmission path in the space is virtually in vacuum with almost zero absorption and decoherence. In this Article, we review the progress in free-space quantum experiments, with a focus on the fast-developing Micius satellite-based quantum communications. The perspective of space-ground integrated quantum networks and fundamental quantum optics experiments in space conceivable with satellites are discussed.},

  abstract = {The Dicke model famously exhibits a phase transition to a superradiant phase with a macroscopic population of photons and is realized in multiple settings in open quantum systems. In this work, we study a variant of the Dicke model where the cavity mode is lossy due to the coupling to a Markovian environment while the atomic mode is coupled to a colored bath. We analytically investigate this model by inspecting its low-frequency behavior via the Schwinger-Keldysh field theory and carefully examine the nature of the corresponding superradiant phase transition. Integrating out the fast modes, we can identify a simple effective theory allowing us to derive analytical expressions for various critical exponents, including those, such as the dynamical critical exponent, that have not been previously considered. We find excellent agreement with previous numerical results when the non-Markovian bath is at zero temperature; however, contrary to these studies, our low-frequency approach reveals that the same exponents govern the critical behavior when the colored bath is at finite temperature unless the chemical potential is zero. Furthermore, we show that the superradiant phase transition is classical in nature, while it is genuinely non-equilibrium. We derive a fractional Langevin equation and conjecture the associated fractional Fokker-Planck equation that capture the system's long-time memory as well as its non-equilibrium behavior. Finally, we consider finite-size effects at the phase transition and identify the finite-size scaling exponents, unlocking a rich behavior in both statics and dynamics of the photonic and atomic observables.}

In contrast, thermalisation erases information about the initial state. This raises a crucial question: How does the thermalising tendency of a quantum channel constrain its signaling power and vice versa? In this work, we address this question by considering three thermodynamic tasks associated with a quantum channel: the generation, preservation, and transmission of athermality. We provide faithful measures for athermality generation and athermality preservation of quantum channels, and prove that their difference quantifies athermality transmission. Analysing these thermodynamic tasks, we find that the signaling ability of a quantum channel is upper-bounded by its athermality preservation and lower-bounded by its athermality transmission, thereby establishing a fundamental relationship between signaling and thermodynamic properties of channels for quantum communication. We demonstrate this interplay for the example of the quantum switch, revealing an explicit trade-off between the signaling ability and athermality of the quantum channels it can implement.},

For general non-relativistic EFTs, we prove that the renormalization group (RG) invariance can be achieved if and only if all single-particle momenta are regulated with a universal cutoff {\textbackslash}Lambda. For a numerical demonstration, we construct a series of N{\textasciicircum}\{2\}LO chiral forces with {\textbackslash}Lambda varying from 250 MeV to 400 MeV. With all low energy constants fixed in two- and three-nucleon systems, we reproduce the experimental binding energies of {\textasciicircum}\{4\}He and {\textasciicircum}\{16\}O nearly independently of {\textbackslash}Lambda. In contrast, all recent nuclear EFT constructions regulate the relative momenta for Galilean invariance, thus inherently break the RG invariance. This explains the unpleasantly strong cutoff-dependences observed in recent ab initio calculations. Our method can also be used to build RG-invariant EFTs with non-perturbative interactions.},

Using four photons, we can actively delay the choice of measurement-implemented via a high-speed tunable bipartite state analyzer and a quantum random number generator-on two of the photons into the time-like future of the registration of the other two photons.

In both cases, predictions are possible despite large uncertainties in the microscopic parameters because these details are compressed into just a few governing parameters that are sufficient to describe relevant observables. We make this commonality explicit by examining parameter sensitivity in a hopping model of diffusion and a generalized Ising model of ferromagnetism. We trace the emergence of a smaller effective model to the development of a hierarchy of parameter importance quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. Strikingly, the same hierarchy appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science. We conclude that the emergence of effective continuum and universal theories in physics is due to the same parameter space hierarchy that underlies predictive modeling in other areas of science.},

Universality of the linear conductance versus the temperature is found for \$T{\textbackslash}lesssim T\_K\$, with \$T\_K\$ a coupling-dependent Kondo-like temperature. At low temperature, coherent heat transfer via virtual processes yields a \${\textbackslash}sim T{\textasciicircum}3\$ behavior with destructive interference in the presence of quasi-degeneracies in the spectrum. As the temperature increases, incoherent emission and absorption dominate and a maximum is reached at \$T{\textbackslash}sim T\_K/2\$.

It it tractable in the large \$N\$ limit, where the classical variable is a bilocal fermion bilinear. The model becomes strongly interacting at low energies where it develops an emergent conformal symmetry. We study two and four point functions of the fundamental fermions. This provides the spectrum of physical excitations for the bilocal field. The emergent conformal symmetry is a reparametrization symmetry, which is spontaneously broken to \$SL(2,R)\$, leading to zero modes. These zero modes are lifted by a small residual explicit breaking, which produces an enhanced contribution to the four point function. This contribution displays a maximal Lyapunov exponent in the chaos region (out of time ordered correlator). We expect these features to be universal properties of large \$N\$ quantum mechanics systems with emergent reparametrization symmetry. This article is largely based on talks given by Kitaev {\textbackslash}cite\{KitaevTalks\}, which motivated us to work out the details of the ideas described there.},

This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large \$N\$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't Hooft limit of 4-d \$\{{\textbackslash}cal N\} =4\$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings. We conjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-deSitter spacetimes are dual to various conformal field theories.

We use the large deviation principle to characterize the statistics of observed ticks within a given time-period and show that it can be sub-Poissonian -- quantified by Mandel's Q parameter -- alluding to the quantum nature of the clock. We discuss the accuracy and efficiency of the clock, and extend our framework to include hybrid quantum clocks fueled by both measurements, and thermal resources.

  abstract = {Over the past few years, a new field of high research intensity has emerged that blends together concepts from gravitational physics and quantum computing. Known as relativistic quantum information, or RQI, the field aims to understand the relationship between special and general relativity and quantum information. Since the original discoveries of Hawking radiation and the Unruh effect, it has been known that incorporating the concepts of quantum theory into relativistic settings can produce new and surprising effects. However it is only in recent years that it has become appreciated that the basic concepts involved in quantum information science undergo significant revision in relativistic settings, and that new phenomena arise when quantum entanglement is combined with relativity. A number of examples illustrate that point. Quantum teleportation fidelity is affected between observers in uniform relative acceleration. Entanglement is an observer-dependent property that is degraded from the perspective of accelerated observers moving in flat spacetime. Entanglement can also be extracted from the vacuum of relativistic quantum field theories, and used to distinguish peculiar motion from cosmological expansion. The new quantum information-theoretic framework of quantum channels in terms of completely positive maps and operator algebras now provides powerful tools for studying matters of causality and information flow in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. This focus issue provides a sample of the state of the art in research in RQI. Some of the articles in this issue review the subject while others provide interesting new results that will stimulate further research. What makes the subject all the more exciting is that it is beginning to enter the stage at which actual experiments can be contemplated, and some of the articles appearing in this issue discuss some of these exciting new developments. The subject of RQI pulls together concepts and ideas from special relativity, quantum optics, general relativity, quantum communication and quantum computation. The high level of current interest in these subjects is exemplified by the recent award of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physics to Serge Haroche and David J Wineland for ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems. It is our hope that this issue will encourage new researchers to enter this rapidly developing and exciting new field. R B Mann and T C Ralph Guest Editors},

  abstract = {Quantum metrology aims to maximize measurement precision on quantum systems, with a wide range of applications in quantum sensing. Achieving the Heisenberg limit (HL) - the fundamental precision bound set by quantum mechanics - is often hindered by noise-induced decoherence, which typically reduces achievable precision to the standard quantum limit (SQL). While quantum error correction (QEC) can recover the HL under Markovian noise, its applicability to non-Markovian noise remains less explored. In this work, we analyze a hidden Markov model in which a quantum probe, coupled to an inaccessible environment, undergoes joint evolution described by Lindbladian dynamics, with the inaccessible degrees of freedom serving as a memory. We derive generalized Knill-Laflamme conditions for the hidden Markov model and establish three types of sufficient conditions for achieving the HL under non-Markovian noise using QEC. Additionally, we demonstrate the attainability of the SQL when these sufficient conditions are violated, by analytical solutions for special cases and numerical methods for general scenarios. Our results not only extend prior QEC frameworks for metrology but also provide new insights into precision limits under realistic noise conditions.},

  abstract = {Quantum non-Markovianity represents memory during the system dynamics, which is typically weakened by the temperature. We here study the effects of environmental temperature on the non-Markovianity of an open quantum system by virtue of collision models. The environment is simulated by a chain of ancillary qubits that are prepared in thermal states with a finite temperature \$T\$. Two distinct non-Markovian mechanisms are considered via two types of collision models, one where the system \$S\$ consecutively interacts with the ancillas and a second where \$S\$ collides only with an intermediate system \$S'\$ which in turn interacts with the ancillas. We show that in both models the relation between non-Markovianity and temperature is non-monotonic. In particular, revivals of non-Markovianity may occur as temperature increases. We find that the physical reason behind this behavior can be revealed by examining a peculiar system-environment coherence exchange, leading to ancillary qubit coherence larger than system coherence which triggers information backflow from the environment to the system. These results provide insights on the mechanisms underlying the counterintuitive phenomenon of temperature-enhanced quantum memory effects.},

Here we provide an introduction to the general theoretical framework to establish and interpret thermodynamics for quantum systems whose nonequilibrium evolution is continuously monitored. We review the formalism of quantum trajectories and its consistent application to the thermodynamic scenario, where main quantities such as work, heat, and entropy production can be defined at the stochastic level.

  abstract = {Developing a thermodynamic theory of computation is a challenging task at the interface of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and computer science. In particular, this task requires dealing with difficulties such as stochastic halting times, unidirectional (possibly deterministic) transitions, and restricted initial conditions, features common in real-world computers. Here, we present a framework which tackles all such difficulties by extending the martingale theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics to generic non-stationary Markovian processes, including those with broken detailed balance and/or absolute irreversibility. We derive several universal fluctuation relations and second-law-like inequalities that provide both lower and upper bounds on the intrinsic dissipation (mismatch cost) associated with any periodic process -- in particular the periodic processes underlying all current digital computation. Crucially, these bounds apply even if the process has stochastic stopping times, as it does in many computational machines. We illustrate our results with exhaustive numerical simulations of deterministic finite automata (DFA) processing bit strings, one of the fundamental models of computation from theoretical computer science. We also provide universal equalities and inequalities for the acceptance probability of words of a given length by a deterministic finite automaton in terms of thermodynamic quantities, and outline connections between computer science and stochastic resetting. Our results, while motivated from the computational context, are applicable far more broadly.},

  abstract = {We present a model for an autonomous quantum thermal machine comprised of two qubits capable of manipulating and even amplifying the local coherence in a non-degenerate external system. The machine uses only thermal resources, namely, contact with two heat baths at different temperatures, and the external system has a non-zero initial amount of coherence. The method we propose allows for an interconversion between energy, both work and heat, and coherence in an autonomous configuration working in out-of-equilibrium conditions. This model raises interesting questions about the role of fundamental limitations on transformations involving coherence and opens up new possibilities in the manipulation of coherence by autonomous thermal machines.}

  abstract = {I consider the long-standing issue of the hermicity of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime metrics. Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc terms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the determinant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a discrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such as the Rindler, de{\textasciitilde}Sitter, and anti-de{\textasciitilde}Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation returns a hermitian or pseudohermitian (\${\textbackslash}mathcal\{PT\}\$-symmetric) Hamiltonian when properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{PT\}\$-symmetry is unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with unitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of time-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation returns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably, this nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric corresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary growth or decay of the time evolution of the field. This suggests a duality between nonhermitian gain and loss phenomena and spacetime contractions and expansions. This metric-induced nonhermiticity unveils an unexpected connection between spacetime metric and nonhermitian phases of matter.},

  abstract = {We propose a protocol by which entanglement can be extracted repeatedly from a quantum field. In analogy with prior work on entanglement harvesting, we call this protocol entanglement farming. It consists of successively sending pairs of unentangled particles through an optical cavity. Using non-perturbative Gaussian methods, we show that in certain generic circumstances this protocol drives the cavity field towards a non-thermal metastable state. This state of the cavity is such that successive pairs of unentangled particles sent through the cavity will reliably emerge significantly entangled. We calculate thermodynamic aspects of the harvesting process, such as energies and entropies, and also the long-term behavior beyond the few-mode approximation. Significant for possible experimental realizations is the fact that this entangling fixed point state of the cavity is reached largely independently of the initial state in which the cavity was prepared. Our results suggest that reliable entanglement farming on the basis of such a fixed point state should be possible also in various other experimental settings, namely with the to-be-entangled particles replaced by arbitrary qudits and with the cavity replaced by a suitable reservoir system.},

Calculating all of its leading terms enables us to fully characterize observable correlations, entanglement, and quantum discord. We apply these results to study detector responses in two locally flat topologically nontrivial spacetimes constructed from identifications of Minkowski space. We demonstrate how local statistics and detector-detector correlations depend on the global spacetime structure. In particular, we show that if the spacetime has a preferred direction, this direction may be inferred from the dependence of correlations between the two detectors on their orientation. While using such measurements to distinguish spacetimes with identical local geometry is apparently impractical, this effect points to fundamental connections between quantum field correlations and the structure of spacetime. This relationship may also be relevant in the phenomenology of the early Universe.}

However, this bound needs to be reinterpreted at microscopic scales, where molecular bio-motors and some artificial micro-engines operate. As described by stochastic thermodynamics, energy transfers in microscopic systems are random and thermal fluctuations induce transient decreases of entropy, allowing for possible violations of the Carnot limit. Despite its potential relevance for the development of a thermodynamics of small systems, an experimental study of microscopic Carnot engines is still lacking. Here we report on an experimental realization of a Carnot engine with a single optically trapped Brownian particle as working substance. We present an exhaustive study of the energetics of the engine and analyze the fluctuations of the finite-time efficiency, showing that the Carnot bound can be surpassed for a small number of non-equilibrium cycles. As its macroscopic counterpart, the energetics of our Carnot device exhibits basic properties that one would expect to observe in any microscopic energy transducer operating with baths at different temperatures. Our results characterize the sources of irreversibility in the engine and the statistical properties of the efficiency -an insight that could inspire novel strategies in the design of efficient nano-motors.},

Beyond its importance in quantum computing, this result can also be regarded as a statement about the dynamics of systems with local Hamiltonians: although locality puts various constraints on the short-term dynamics, it does not restrict the possible unitary evolutions that a composite system with a general local Hamiltonian can experience after a sufficiently long time. Here we show that this universality does not remain valid in the presence of conservation laws and global continuous symmetries such as U(1) and SU(2). In particular, we show that generic symmetric unitaries cannot be implemented, even approximately, using local symmetric unitaries. Based on this no-go theorem, we propose a method for experimentally probing the locality of interactions in nature. In the context of quantum thermodynamics, our results mean that generic energy-conserving unitary transformations on a composite system cannot be realized solely by combining local energy-conserving unitaries on the components. We show how this can be circumvented via catalysis.},

We quantify the resources needed to cool a system to any temperature, and translate these resources into the minimal time or number of steps, by considering the notion of a thermal machine that obeys similar restrictions to universal computers. We generally find that the obtainable temperature can scale as an inverse power of the cooling time.

Remarkable progress has been made recently in the miniaturization of heat engines all the way to the single Brownian particle as well as to a single atom. However, despite several theoretical proposals, the implementation of heat machines in the fully quantum regime remains a challenge. Here, we report an experimental realization of a quantum absorption refrigerator in a system of three trapped ions, with three of its normal modes of motion coupled by a trilinear Hamiltonian such that heat transfer between two modes refrigerates the third. We investigate the dynamics and steady-state properties of the refrigerator and compare its cooling capability when only thermal states are involved to the case when squeezing is employed as a quantum resource. We also study the performance of such a refrigerator in the single shot regime, and demonstrate cooling below both the steady-state energy and the benchmark predicted by the classical thermodynamics treatment.},

Geometrically they describe holomorphic maps to spaces of complex null geodesics, known as ambitwistor spaces. They have the standard critical space-time dimensions of string theory (26 in the bosonic case and 10 for the superstring). Quantization leads to the formulae for tree-level scattering amplitudes of massless particles found recently by Cachazo, He and Yuan. These representations localize the vertex operators to solutions of the same equations found by Gross and Mende to govern the behaviour of strings in the limit of high energy, fixed angle scattering. Here, localization to the scattering equations emerges naturally as a consequence of working on ambitwistor space. The worldsheet theory suggests a way to extend these amplitudes to spinor fields and to loop level.

It is often believed that Hawking's argument is not precisely formulated, and a more careful accounting of naturally occurring quantum corrections will allow the radiation process to become unitary. We show that such is not the case, by proving that small corrections to the leading order Hawking computation cannot remove the entanglement between the radiation and the hole. We formulate Hawking's argument as a 'theorem': assuming 'traditional' physics at the horizon and usual assumptions of locality we will be forced into mixed states or remnants. We also argue that one cannot explain away the problem by invoking AdS/CFT duality. We conclude with recent results on the quantum physics of black holes which show that the interior of black holes have a 'fuzzball' structure. This nontrivial structure of microstates resolves the information paradox and gives a qualitative picture of how classical intuition can break down in black hole physics. {\copyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.}

  abstract = {We consider an operational restatement of the holographic principle, which we call the principle of asymptotic quantum tasks. Asymptotic quantum tasks are quantum information processing tasks with inputs given and outputs required on points at the boundary of a spacetime. The principle of asymptotic quantum tasks states that tasks which are possible using the bulk dynamics should coincide with tasks that are possible using the boundary. We extract consequences of this principle for holography in the context of asymptotically AdS spacetimes. We argue for a novel connection between bulk causal structure and the phase transition in the boundary mutual information. Further, we note a connection between holography and quantum cryptography, where the problem of completing asymptotic quantum tasks has been studied earlier. We study the cryptographic and AdS/CFT approaches to completing asymptotic quantum tasks and consider the efficiency with which they replace bulk classical geometry with boundary entanglement.},

  abstract = {The choice of mathematical representation when describing physical systems is of great consequence, and this choice is usually determined by the properties of the problem at hand. Here we examine the little-known wave operator representation of quantum dynamics and explore its connection to standard methods of quantum dynamics, such as the Wigner phase-space function. This method takes as its central object the square root of the density matrix and consequently enjoys several unusual advantages over standard representations. By combining this with purification techniques imported from quantum information, we are able to obtain a number of results. Not only is this formalism able to provide a natural bridge between phase- and Hilbert-space representations of both quantum and classical dynamics, we also find the wave operator representation leads to semiclassical approximations of both real and imaginary time dynamics, as well as a transparent correspondence to the classical limit. It is then demonstrated that there exist a number of scenarios (such as thermalization) in which the wave operator representation possesses an equivalent unitary evolution, which corresponds to nonlinear real-time dynamics for the density matrix. We argue that the wave operator provides a new perspective that links previously unrelated representations and is a natural candidate model for scenarios (such as hybrids) in which positivity cannot be otherwise guaranteed.},

All these constructions use no additional entangling gate layers and display essentially the same logical performance, having teraquop footprints within 25\% of the standard surface code circuit.

  abstract = {Quantum error correction (QEC) provides a practical path to fault-tolerant quantum computing through scaling to large qubit numbers, assuming that physical errors are sufficiently uncorrelated in time and space. In superconducting qubit arrays, high-energy impact events can produce correlated errors, violating this key assumption. Following such an event, phonons with energy above the superconducting gap propagate throughout the device substrate, which in turn generate a temporary surge in quasiparticle (QP) density throughout the array. When these QPs tunnel across the qubits' Josephson junctions, they induce correlated errors. Engineering different superconducting gaps across the qubit's Josephson junctions provides a method to resist this form of QP tunneling. By fabricating all-aluminum transmon qubits with both strong and weak gap engineering on the same substrate, we observe starkly different responses during high-energy impact events. Strongly gap engineered qubits do not show any degradation in                                                                                               T                                                                 1                                                                                       during impact events, while weakly gap engineered qubits show events of correlated degradation in                                                   T                   1                                               .

  abstract = {Scalable quantum computing can become a reality with error correction, provided coherent qubits can be constructed in large arrays. The key premise is that physical errors can remain both small and sufficiently uncorrelated as devices scale, so that logical error rates can be exponentially suppressed. However, energetic impacts from cosmic rays and latent radioactivity violate both of these assumptions. An impinging particle ionizes the substrate, radiating high energy phonons that induce a burst of quasiparticles, destroying qubit coherence throughout the device. High-energy radiation has been identified as a source of error in pilot superconducting quantum devices, but lacking a measurement technique able to resolve a single event in detail, the effect on large scale algorithms and error correction in particular remains an open question. Elucidating the physics involved requires operating large numbers of qubits at the same rapid timescales as in error correction, exposing the event's evolution in time and spread in space. Here, we directly observe high-energy rays impacting a large-scale quantum processor. We introduce a rapid space and time-multiplexed measurement method and identify large bursts of quasiparticles that simultaneously and severely limit the energy coherence of all qubits, causing chip-wide failure. We track the events from their initial localised impact to high error rates across the chip. Our results provide direct insights into the scale and dynamics of these damaging error bursts in large-scale devices, and highlight the necessity of mitigation to enable quantum computing to scale.},

This issue is particularly pronounced at microscopic and quantum scales, where its mitigation requires additional entropy dissipation. Understanding this constraint is important for both fundamental physics and technological design. Clocks, for example, need a thermodynamic flux towards equilibrium to measure time, resulting in a minimum entropy dissipation per clock tick. Although classical and quantum models often show a linear relationship between precision and dissipation, the ultimate bounds on this relationship remain unclear. Here we present an autonomous quantum many-body clock model that achieves clock precision that scales exponentially with entropy dissipation. This is enabled by coherent transport in a spin chain with tailored couplings, where dissipation is confined to a single link. The result demonstrates that coherent quantum dynamics can surpass the traditional thermodynamic precision limits, potentially guiding the development of future high-precision, low-dissipation quantum devices.},

  abstract = {Energy consumption in solving computational problems has been gaining growing attention as one of the key performance measures for computers. Quantum computation is known to offer advantages over classical computation in terms of various computational resources; however, proving its energy-consumption advantage has been challenging due to the lack of a theoretical foundation linking the physical concept of energy with the computer-scientific notion of complexity for quantum computation. To bridge this gap, we introduce a general framework for studying the energy consumption of quantum and classical computation, based on a computational model conventionally used for studying query complexity in computational complexity theory. Within this framework, we derive an upper bound for the achievable energy consumption of quantum computation, accounting for imperfections in implementation appearing in practice. As part of this analysis, we construct a protocol for Landauer erasure with finite precision in a finite number of steps, which constitutes a contribution of independent interest. Additionally, we develop techniques for proving a nonzero lower bound of energy consumption of classical computation, based on the energy-conservation law and Landauer's principle. Using these general bounds, we rigorously prove that quantum computation achieves an exponential energy-consumption advantage over classical computation for solving a paradigmatic computational problem -- Simon's problem. Furthermore, we propose explicit criteria for experimentally demonstrating this energy-consumption advantage of quantum computation, analogous to the experimental demonstrations of quantum computational supremacy. These results establish a foundational framework and techniques to explore the energy consumption of computation, opening an alternative way to study the advantages of quantum computation.},

  abstract = {We consider two bottlenecks in quantum computing: limited memory size and noise caused by heat dissipation. Trying to optimize both, we investigate "on-the-go erasure" of quantum registers that are no longer needed for a given algorithm: freeing up auxiliary qubits as they stop being useful would facilitate the parallelization of computations. We study the minimal thermodynamic cost of erasure in these scenarios, applying results on the Landauer erasure of entangled quantum registers. For the class of algorithms solving the Abelian hidden subgroup problem, we find optimal on-the-go erasure protocols. We conclude that there is a trade-off: if we have enough partial information about a problem to build efficient on-the-go erasure, we can use it to instead simplify the algorithm, so that fewer qubits are needed to run the computation in the first place. We provide explicit protocols for these two approaches.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Biological systems often consist of a small number of constituents and are therefore inherently noisy. To function effectively, these systems must employ mechanisms to constrain the accumulation of noise. Such mechanisms have been extensively studied and comprise the constraint by external forces, nonlinear interactions, or the resetting of the system to a predefined state. Here, we propose a fourth paradigm for noise constraint: self-organized resetting, where the resetting rate and position emerge from self-organization through time-discrete interactions. We study general properties of self-organized resetting systems using the paradigmatic example of cooperative resetting, where random pairs of Brownian particles are reset to their respective average. We demonstrate that such systems undergo a delocalization phase transition, separating regimes of constrained and unconstrained noise accumulation. Additionally, we show that systems with self-organized resetting can adapt to external forces and optimize search behavior for reaching target values. Self-organized resetting has various applications in nature and technology, which we demonstrate in the context of sexual interactions in fungi and spatial dispersion in shared mobility services. This work opens routes into the application of self-organized resetting across various systems in biology and technology.},

  abstract = {Several implications of well-known fluctuation theorems, on the statistical properties of the entropy production, are studied using various approaches. We begin by deriving a tight lower bound on the variance of the entropy production for a given mean of this random variable. It is shown that the Evans-Searles fluctuation theorem alone imposes a significant lower bound on the variance only when the mean entropy production is very small. It is then nonetheless demonstrated that upon incorporating additional information concerning the entropy production, this lower bound can be significantly improved, so as to capture extensivity properties. Another important aspect of the fluctuation properties of the entropy production is the relationship between the mean and the variance, on the one hand, and the probability of the event where the entropy production is negative, on the other hand. Accordingly, we derive upper and lower bounds on this probability in terms of the mean and the variance. These bounds are tighter than previous bounds that can be found in the literature. Moreover, they are tight in the sense that there exist probability distributions, satisfying the Evans-Searles fluctuation theorem, that achieve them with equality. Finally, we present a general method for generating a wide class of inequalities that must be satisfied by the entropy production. We use this method to derive several new inequalities which go beyond the standard derivation of the second law.},

Using examples I show that these constraints necessarily limit the performance of clocks and that good clocks require large energy dissipation. For periodic clocks, operating on a limit cycle, this is a consequence of phase diffusion. It is also true for non periodic clocks (for example, radio carbon dating) but due to telegraph noise not to phase diffusion. In this case a key role is played by accurate measurements that decrease entropy, thereby raising the free energy of the clock, and requires access to a low entropy reservoir. In the quantum case, for which thermal noise is replaced by quantum noise (spontaneous emission or tunnelling), measurement plays an essential role for both periodic and non periodic clocks. The paper concludes with a discussion of the Tolman relations and Rovelli's thermal time hypothesis in terms of clock thermodynamics.},

The method of decoy states can detect photon-number-splitting eavesdropping and thus enables, in theory, secure QKD using weak coherent pulses over long distances with high channel loss inherent in satellite communication systems. However, it is widely known that realistic QKD devices can be vulnerable to various types of side-channel attacks that rely on flaws in experimental implementation. In most free-space QKD systems, including that on board Micius, multiple semiconductor lasers with passive optics are utilized to randomly generate polarization states. Optical pulses from independent laser diodes can to some extent differ in their temporal, spectral, and/or spatial distribution, and the quantum states can thus be distinguishable. Such distinguishability of photons in additional non-operational degrees of freedom compromises unconditional security of QKD since an eavesdropper can exploit this loophole to improve their attack strategy. The author carried out a thorough analysis of the experimental data obtained during multiple communication sessions between Micius and one of the ground stations designed specifically for it. Relative time delays between all the eight laser diodes on board have been found. The typical desynchronization between the lasers exceeds 100 ps, which is comparable with their pulse duration of 200 ps. The largest time delay was observed between signal and decoy states for vertically polarized photons and is about 300 ps. With such mismatch in timing, a potential attacker using as perfect equipment as possible unless it violates the laws of physics was shown to be capable of distinguishing decoy states from signal ones in at least 98.7\% of cases.},

When it comes to quantum stochastic processes, however, the topic is plagued with pathological issues that have led to fierce debates amongst researchers. Recent developments have begun to untangle these issues and paved the way for generalizing the theory of classical stochastic processes to the quantum domain without ambiguities. This tutorial details the structure of quantum stochastic processes, in terms of the modern language of quantum combs, and is aimed at students in quantum physics and quantum information theory. We begin with the basics of classical stochastic processes and generalize the same ideas to the quantum domain. Along the way, we discuss the subtle structure of quantum physics that has led to troubles in forming an overarching theory for quantum stochastic processes. We close the tutorial by laying out many exciting problems that lie ahead in this branch of science.},

While the lack of a thermodynamic potential for these out-of-equilibrium open systems makes it theoretically challenging to investigate their physics, at the same time it allows going beyond the thermodynamic paradigms and investigating new and exotic phenomena. We will focus on one of the simplest, yet most effective, descriptions of open quantum systems, namely the (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-) Lindblad master equation. This phenomenological approach describes quantum systems that weakly interact with their surrounding environment.

  abstract = {The Exceptional Points (EPs) of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) are spectral degeneracies associated with coalescing eigenvalues and eigenvectors which are associated with remarkable dynamical properties. These EPs can be generated experimentally in open quantum systems, evolving under a Lindblad equation, by postselecting on trajectories that present no quantum jumps, such that the dynamics is ruled by a NHH. Interestingly, changing the way the information used for postselection is collected leads to different unravelings, i.e., different set of trajectories which average to the same Lindblad equation, but are associated with a different NHH. Here, we exploit this mechanism to create and control EPs solely by changing the measurement we postselect on. Our scheme is based on a realistic homodyne reading of the emitted leaking photons with a weak-intensity laser (a process which we call \${\textbackslash}beta\$-dyne), which we show generates a tunable NHH, that can exhibit EPs even though the system does have any in the absence of the laser. We consider a few illustrative examples pointing the dramatic effects that different postselections can have on the spectral features of the NHH, paving the road towards engineering of EPs in simple quantum systems.},

  abstract = {Engineered dissipative reservoirs have the potential to steer many-body quantum systems toward correlated steady states useful for quantum simulation of high-temperature superconductivity or quantum magnetism. Using up to 49 superconducting qubits, we prepared low-energy states of the transverse-field Ising model through coupling to dissipative auxiliary qubits. In one dimension, we observed long-range quantum correlations and a ground-state fidelity of 0.86 for 18 qubits at the critical point. In two dimensions, we found mutual information that extends beyond nearest neighbors. Lastly, by coupling the system to auxiliaries emulating reservoirs with different chemical potentials, we explored transport in the quantum Heisenberg model. Our results establish engineered dissipation as a scalable alternative to unitary evolution for preparing entangled many-body states on noisy quantum processors.}

A primary objective of current research is to find thermodynamic tasks which can be enhanced by quantum mechanical effects. With this goal in mind, we explore the finite-time dynamics of absorption refrigerators composed of three qubits. The aim of this finite-time cooling is to reach low temperatures as fast as possible and subsequently extract the cold particle to exploit it for information processing purposes. We show that the coherent oscillations inherent to quantum dynamics can be harnessed to reach temperatures that are colder than the steady state in orders of magnitude less time, thereby providing a fast source of low-entropy qubits. This effect demonstrates that quantum thermal machines can surpass classical ones, reminiscent of quantum advantages in other fields, and is applicable to a broad range of technologically important scenarios.},

The observation of thermalization in completely isolated quantum systems, such as cold-atom quantum simulators, implies that a temperature can be assigned even to individual, pure quantum states. Here, we propose a scheme to measure the temperature of such pure states through quantum interference. Our proposal involves interferometry of an auxiliary qubit probe, which is prepared in a superposition state and subsequently decoheres due to weak coupling with a closed, thermalized many-body system. Using only a few basic assumptions about chaotic quantum systems, namely, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and the emergence of hydrodynamics at long times, we show that the qubit undergoes pure exponential decoherence at a rate that depends on the temperature of its surroundings. We verify our predictions by numerical experiments on a quantum spin chain that thermalizes after absorbing energy from a periodic drive. Our Letter provides a general method to measure the temperature of isolated, strongly interacting systems under minimal assumptions.},

  abstract = {One of the best signatures of nonclassicality in a quantum system is the existence of correlations that have no classical counterpart. Different methods for quantifying the quantum and classical parts of correlations are amongst the more actively-studied topics of quantum information theory over the past decade. Entanglement is the most prominent of these correlations, but in many cases unentangled states exhibit nonclassical behavior too. Thus distinguishing quantum correlations other than entanglement provides a better division between the quantum and classical worlds, especially when considering mixed states. Here we review different notions of classical and quantum correlations quantified by quantum discord and other related measures. In the first half, we review the mathematical properties of the measures of quantum correlations, relate them to each other, and discuss the classical-quantum division that is common among them. In the second half, we show that the measures identify and quantify the deviation from classicality in various quantum-information-processing tasks, quantum thermodynamics, open-system dynamics, and many-body physics. We show that in many cases quantum correlations indicate an advantage of quantum methods over classical ones.}

In this work, we identify a class of experimentally accessible quantum systems where thermal density matrices emerge from vacuum entanglement. We show that reduced density matrices of lower-dimensional subsystems embedded in \$D\$-dimensional gapped Dirac fermion vacuum, either on a lattice or continuum, have a thermal form with respect to a lower-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian. Strikingly, we show that vacuum entanglement can even conspire to make a subsystem of a gapped system at zero temperature appear as a hot gapless system. We propose concrete experiments in cold atom quantum simulators to observe the vacuum entanglement induced thermal states.},

As shown recently, such unattainability implies that a unitary interaction between the measured system and a measuring apparatus can never implement an ideal projective measurement. In this paper, we introduce an operational formulation of the third law for the most general class of physical transformations, the violation of which is both necessary and sufficient for the preparation of pure states. Subsequently, we investigate how such a law constrains measurements of general observables, or positive operator valued measures. We identify several desirable properties of measurements which are simultaneously enjoyed by ideal projective measurements -- and are hence all ruled out by the third law in such a case -- and determine if the third law allows for these properties to obtain for general measurements of general observables and, if so, under what conditions. It is shown that while the third law rules out some of these properties for all observables, others may be enjoyed by observables that are sufficiently "unsharp".},

Of particular importance is the description of stroke-based engines which can operate at finite-time. In this paper we put forth a framework for describing stroboscopic, two-stroke engines, in generic quantum chains. The framework is a generalization of the so-called SWAP engine and is based on a collisional model, which alternates between pure heat and pure work strokes. The transient evolution towards a limit-cycle is also fully accounted for. Moreover, we show that once the limit-cycle has been reached, the energy of the internal sites of the chain no longer changes, with the heat currents being associated exclusively to the boundary sites. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we show that this type of engine offers multiple ways of optimizing the output power, without affecting the efficiency. Finally, we also show that there exists an entire class of models, characterized by a specific type of inter-chain interaction, which always operate at Otto efficiency, irrespective of the operating conditions of the reservoirs.},

This approach can be applied to a wide class of relaxation operators in the Markovian regime, and it is equivalent to the standard master-equation approach. For systems with a number of states N much larger than unity this Monte Carlo wave-function approach can be less expensive in terms of calculation time than the master-equation treatment. Indeed, a wave function involves only N components, whereas a density matrix is described by N2 terms.

Quantum cooling algorithms offer a promising alternative to other methods based, for instance, on variational and adiabatic principles, or on dissipative state preparation. In this work, we investigate a set of cooling algorithms in a simple, solvable fermionic model which allows us to identify the mechanisms which underlie the cooling process and, also, those which prevent it. We derive analytical expressions for the cooling dynamics, steady states, and cooling rates in the weak coupling limit. We find that multi-frequency and randomized cycle strategies can significantly enhance the performance of the quantum algorithm and circumvent some of the obstacles. We also analyze the effects of noise and evaluate the conditions under which cooling remains feasible. Furthermore, we present optimized cooling protocols that can significantly enhance cooling performance in the presence of noise. Additionally, we compare cooling and dissipative state preparation and show that, in the model analyzed here, cooling generally achieves lower energies and is more resilient to noise.},

  abstract = {Quantum teleportation is a quintessential quantum communication protocol that enables the transmission of an arbitrary quantum state between two distant parties without physically transmitting the state with the help of shared entanglement and limited classical communication. We show that it is possible to relax the entanglement requirement in quantum teleportation if we have access to a certain strain of superposition of quantum processes. Two types of superposition of quantum processes are generally considered in the literature: superposition of paths identified with quantum maps and superposition of indefinite causal orders of the maps. We find that when superposition of paths is incorporated in the protocol, perfect quantum teleportation becomes possible with nonzero probability, even when the two parties share certain classes of separable states, including pure product states. In contrast, the assistance of superposition of indefinite causal order of quantum maps in teleportation protocol does not enable any quantum advantage for shared pure product states. Furthermore, we show that separable Werner states can also yield quantum advantage in quantum teleportation assisted by the superposition of paths. Finally, we establish that the presence of quantum coherence in the control qubit is both necessary and sufficient to achieve quantum advantage in quantum teleportation assisted with superposition of paths. Our results highlight that while entanglement is a fundamental resource in standard quantum teleportation, superposition of paths can serve as an alternate resource for the same.},

Effective spins are represented by appropriate internal energy levels within each ion, and the spins can be measured with near-perfect efficiency using state-dependent fluorescence techniques. By applying optical fields that exert optical dipole forces on the ions, their Coulomb interaction can be modulated to produce long-range and tunable spin-spin interactions that can be reconfigured by shaping the spectrum and pattern of the laser fields, in a prototypical example of a quantum simulator. Here we review the theoretical mapping of atomic ions to interacting spin systems, the preparation of complex equilibrium states, the study of dynamical processes in these many-body interacting quantum systems, and the use of this platform for optimization and other tasks. The use of such quantum simulators for studying spin models may inform our understanding of exotic quantum materials and shed light on the behavior of interacting quantum systems that cannot be modeled with conventional computers.},

  abstract = {Contextuality has long been associated with topological properties. In this work, such a relationship is elevated to identification in the broader framework of generalized contextuality. We employ the usual identification of states, effects, and transformations as vectors in a vector space and encode them into a tangent space, rendering the noncontextual conditions the generic condition that discrete closed paths imply null phases in valuations, which are immediately extended to the continuous case. Contextual behavior admits two equivalent interpretations in this formalism. In the geometric or intrinsic-realistic view, termed "Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger", flat space is imposed, leading to contextual behavior being expressed as non-trivial holonomy of probabilistic functions, analogous to the electromagnetic tensor. As a modification of the valuation function, we use the equivalent curvature to connect contextuality with interference, noncommutativity, and signed measures. In the topological or participatory-realistic view, termed "Heisenberg", valuation functions must satisfy classical measure axioms, resulting in contextual behavior needing to be expressed in topological defects in events, resulting in non-trivial monodromy. We utilize such defects to connect contextuality with non-embeddability and to construct a generalized Vorob'ev theorem, a result regarding the inevitability of noncontextuality. We identify in this formalism the contextual fraction for models with outcome-determinism, and a pathway to address disturbance in ontological models as non-trivial transition maps. We also discuss how the two views for encoding contextuality relate to interpretations of quantum theory.},

  abstract = {Quantum systems, fabricated across various spatial scales from nano to micrometers, are very delicate and naturally sensitive to the variations of their environment. These features make them excellent candidates for serving as sensors with wide range of applications. Indeed, the exceptional precision of quantum sensors arises from their compact size and inherent sensitivity, enabling measurements with unprecedented accuracy within highly localized regions. A key advantage of quantum sensors lies in their resource efficiency, as their achievable precision can scale super-linearly with respect to resources, such as system size, in contrast to the linear scaling characteristic of classical sensors. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as quantum-enhanced sensitivity, fundamentally depends on exploiting uniquely quantum mechanical features, including superposition, entanglement, and squeezing. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for particles prepared in a special form of entangled states. Yet, certain realization of these probes may be susceptible to decoherence and interaction between particles may also be detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed through exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used for sensing purposes in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality, as a well-studied subject in many-body physics, has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in both of these scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first order, second order, topological, and localization phase transitions have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum-enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities, either in equilibrium or non-equilibrium scenarios, has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity and that is energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time becomes another parameter which can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In this review, we provide an overview on recent progresses on different aspects of quantum metrology and sensing with many-body systems.},

However, this beauty is often buried underneath layers of unnecessary formalism, and exciting recent results such as interactive proofs, phase transitions, and quantum computing are usually considered too advanced for the typical student. This book bridges these gaps by explaining the deep ideas of theoretical computer science in a clear fashion, making them accessible to non-computer scientists and to computer scientists who finally want to appreciate their field from a new point of view. It starts with a lucid explanation of the P vs. NP problem, explaining why it is so fundamental, and so hard to resolve. It then leads the reader through the complexity of mazes and games; optimisation in theory and practice; randomised algorithms, interactive proofs, and pseudorandomness; Markov chains and phase transitions; and the outer reaches of quantum computing. At every turn, it uses a minimum of formalism, providing explanations that are both deep and accessible.},

  abstract = {Controlling matter to simultaneously support multiple coupled properties is of fundamental and technological importance. For example, the simultaneous presence of magnetic and ferroelectric orders in multiferroic materials leads to enhanced functionalities. In high-temperature superconductors, intertwining between charge- and spin-order can form superconducting states at high transition temperatures. However, pinning down the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the simultaneous presence of different orders is difficult, making it hard to predict the phenomenology of a material or to experimentally modify its properties. Here we use a quantum gas to engineer an adjustable interaction at the microscopic level between two orders, and demonstrate scenarios of competition, coexistence and coupling between them. In the latter case, intriguingly, the presence of one order lowers the critical point of the other. Our system is realized by a Bose-Einstein condensate which can undergo self-organization phase transitions in two optical resonators, resulting in two distinct crystalline density orders. We characterize the intertwining between these orders by measuring the composite order parameter and the elementary excitations. We explain our results with a mean-field free energy model, which is derived from a microscopic Hamiltonian. Our system is ideally suited to explore properties of quantum tricritical points as recently realized in and can be extended to study the interplay of spin and density orders also as a function of temperature.}

Here we consider the functionality of systems, notably operations in socio-technical ones, production in economic ones and, more generally, any schedule-based system, where timing is of crucial importance. We introduce a stylized model of delay propagation on temporal networks, where the magnitude of delay-mitigating buffer acts as a control parameter.

This fact permits to preserve all nice properties of the Newton-Wigner position observable, dropping the unphysical features arising from the Hegerfeldt theorem. The considered POVM does not permit spatially sharply localized states, but it admits families of almost localized states with arbitrary precision. Next, I establish that the Terno localization observable satisfies part of a requirement introduced by D.P.L.Castrigiano about causal temporal evolution concerning the Lebesgue measurable spatial regions of any Minkowskian reference frame. The validity of the complete Castrigiano's causality requirement is also proved for a notion of spatial localization which generalizes Terno's one in a natural way.},

  abstract = {While celebrating the 100th anniversary of the discovery of special relativity [1], it may not be inappropriate to open a window on the de Sitter universes, as their importance in contemporary physics is gradually increasing. Just to mention two examples, the astronomical evidence for an accelerated expansion of the universe gives a central place to the de Sitter geometry in cosmology [2] while the so-called AdS/CFT correspondence [3] supports a major role for the anti-de Sitter geometry in theoretical physics. From the geometrical viewpoint, among the cousins of Minkowski spacetime (the class of Lorentzian manifolds) de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetimes are its closest relatives. Indeed, like the Minkowski spacetime, they are maximally symmetric, i.e. they admit kinematical symmetry groups having ten generators1 . Maximal symmetry also implies that the curvature is constant (zero in the Minkowski case). Owing to their symmetry, it is possible to give a description of the de Sitter universes without using the machinery of general relativity at all. However, it is worth saying right away that, even if they share important features with Minkowski spacetime, their physical interpretation is quite different and the technical problems to be solved in order to merge de Sitter spacetimes with quantum physics are considerably harder. The aim of this note is to give a simple and short geometrical introduction to the de Sitter and anti-de Sitter universes and to briefly comment on their physical meaning.},

  abstract = {Quantum algorithms for probing ground-state properties of quantum systems require good initial states. Projection-based methods such as eigenvalue filtering rely on inputs that have a significant overlap with the low-energy subspace, which can be challenging for large, strongly-correlated systems. This issue has motivated the study of physically-inspired dynamical approaches such as thermodynamic cooling. In this work, we introduce a ground-state preparation algorithm based on the simulation of quantum dynamics. Our main insight is to transform the Hamiltonian by a shifted sign function via quantum signal processing, effectively mapping eigenvalues into positive and negative subspaces separated by a large gap. This automatically ensures that all states within each subspace conserve energy with respect to the transformed Hamiltonian. Subsequent time-evolution with a perturbed Hamiltonian induces transitions to lower-energy states while preventing unwanted jumps to higher energy states. The approach does not rely on a priori knowledge of energy gaps and requires no additional qubits to model a bath. Furthermore, it makes \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}(d{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash},3/2\}/{\textbackslash}epsilon)\$ queries to the time-evolution operator of the system and \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}(d{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash},3/2\})\$ queries to a block-encoding of the perturbation, for \$d\$ cooling steps and an \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-accurate energy resolution. Our results provide a framework for combining quantum signal processing and Hamiltonian simulation to design heuristic quantum algorithms for ground-state preparation.},

Given the challenges posed in constructing large-scale quantum computers, these tasks should be carried out in a resource-efficient way. In this regard, existing techniques based on phase estimation or variational algorithms display potential disadvantages; phase estimation requires deep circuits with ancillae, that are hard to execute reliably without error correction, while variational algorithms, while flexible with respect to circuit depth, entail additional high-dimensional classical optimization. Here, we introduce the quantum imaginary time evolution and quantum Lanczos algorithms, which are analogues of classical algorithms for finding ground and excited states. Compared to their classical counterparts, they require exponentially less space and time per iteration, and can be implemented without deep circuits and ancillae, or high-dimensional optimization. We furthermore discuss quantum imaginary time evolution as a subroutine to generate Gibbs averages through an analog of minimally entangled typical thermal states. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of these algorithms via an implementation using exact classical emulation as well as through prototype circuits on the Rigetti quantum virtual machine and Aspen-1 quantum processing unit.},

The accurate evaluation of TURs is a necessary requirement to quantify the fluctuation and dissipation entailed by a thermodynamic process, and ultimately to optimize the performance of quantum devices, whose operation is fundamentally a quantum thermodynamic process. Here, we simulate TURs in a transverse-field Ising model subjected to a time-dependent driving protocol, using quantum and classical computers in concert. Varying the duration and strength of the drive as well as the system size, we verify the validity of TURs, identify quantum signatures in the work statistics within the linear response regime, and observe TUR saturation in the high-temperature limit.},

  abstract = {Thermodynamics at the nanoscale is known to differ significantly from its familiar macroscopic counterpart: the possibility of state transitions is not determined by free energy alone, but by an infinite family of free-energy-like quantities; strong fluctuations (possibly of quantum origin) allow to extract less work reliably than what is expected from computing the free energy difference. However, these known results rely crucially on the assumption that the thermal machine is not only exactly preserved in every cycle, but also kept uncorrelated from the quantum systems on which it acts. Here we lift this restriction: we allow the machine to become correlated with the microscopic systems on which it acts, while still exactly preserving its own state. Surprisingly, we show that this restores the second law in its original form: free energy alone determines the possible state transitions, and the corresponding amount of work can be invested or extracted from single systems exactly and without any fluctuations. At the same time, the work reservoir remains uncorrelated from all other systems and parts of the machine. Thus, microscopic machines can increase their efficiency via clever "correlation engineering" in a perfectly cyclic manner, which is achieved by a catalytic system that can sometimes be as small as a single qubit (though some setups require very large catalysts). Our results also solve some open mathematical problems on majorization which may lead to further applications in entanglement theory.},

They appear in the form of unconditional and conditional entropies, relative entropies or mutual information, and have found many applications in information theory and beyond. Various generalizations of Renyi entropies to the quantum setting have been proposed, most notably Petz's quasi-entropies and Renner's conditional min-, max- and collision entropy. Here, we argue that previous quantum extensions are incompatible and thus unsatisfactory. We propose a new quantum generalization of the family of Renyi entropies that contains the von Neumann entropy, min-entropy, collision entropy and the max-entropy as special cases, thus encompassing most quantum entropies in use today. We show several natural properties for this definition, including data-processing inequalities, a duality relation, and an entropic uncertainty relation.},

For the first time, we establish clear and concise conditions for ensuring that the resulting effective theories are causal, stable, and well-posed within general relativity. These properties are independent of spacetime foliation and are valid in the full nonlinear regime. Out-of-equilibrium fluctuations are constrained by a relativistically covariant version of Crooks fluctuation theorem, which determines how the entropy production is distributed even when the system is driven by an external force. This leads to an emerging \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ symmetry responsible for imposing fluctuation-dissipation relations for n-point correlation functions, which matches the standard constraints for the Schwinger-Keldysh effective action.},

  abstract = {Quantum complexity measures the difficulty of realizing a quantum process, such as preparing a state or implementing a unitary. We present an approach to quantifying the thermodynamic resources required to implement a process if the process's complexity is restricted. We focus on the prototypical task of information erasure, or Landauer erasure, wherein an n-qubit memory is reset to the all-zero state. We show that the minimum thermodynamic work required to reset an arbitrary state, via a complexity-constrained process, is quantified by the state's complexity entropy. The complexity entropy therefore quantifies a trade-off between the work cost and complexity cost of resetting a state. If the qubits have a nontrivial (but product) Hamiltonian, the optimal work cost is determined by the complexity relative entropy. The complexity entropy quantifies the amount of randomness a system appears to have to a computationally limited observer. Similarly, the complexity relative entropy quantifies such an observer's ability to distinguish two states. We prove elementary properties of the complexity (relative) entropy and determine the complexity entropy's behavior under random circuits. Also, we identify information-theoretic applications of the complexity entropy. The complexity entropy quantifies the resources required for data compression if the compression algorithm must use a restricted number of gates. We further introduce a complexity conditional entropy, which arises naturally in a complexity-constrained variant of information-theoretic decoupling. Assuming that this entropy obeys a conjectured chain rule, we show that the entropy bounds the number of qubits that one can decouple from a reference system, as judged by a computationally bounded referee. Overall, our framework extends the resource-theoretic approach to thermodynamics to integrate a notion of time, as quantified by complexity.},

  abstract = {The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) explains why chaotic quantum many-body systems thermalize internally if the Hamiltonian lacks symmetries. If the Hamiltonian conserves one quantity ("charge"), the ETH implies thermalization within a charge sector -- in a microcanonical subspace. But quantum systems can have charges that fail to commute with each other and so share no eigenbasis; microcanonical subspaces may not exist. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian will have degeneracies, so the ETH need not imply thermalization. We adapt the ETH to noncommuting charges by positing a non-Abelian ETH and invoking the approximate microcanonical subspace introduced in quantum thermodynamics. Illustrating with SU(2) symmetry, we apply the non-Abelian ETH in calculating local observables' time-averaged and thermal expectation values. In many cases, we prove, the time average thermalizes. However, we also find cases in which, under a physically reasonable assumption, the time average converges to the thermal average unusually slowly as a function of the global-system size. This work extends the ETH, a cornerstone of many-body physics, to noncommuting charges, recently a subject of intense activity in quantum thermodynamics.},

The recent, rapid development of quantum thermodynamics has taken a similar trajectory, and, e.g., "quantum engines" have become a widely studied concept in theoretical research. However, if the newly unveiled laws of nature are to be useful, we need to write the dictionary that allows us to translate abstract statements of theoretical quantum thermodynamics to physical platforms and working mediums of experimentally realistic scenarios. To assist in this endeavor, this review is dedicated to providing an overview over the proposed and realized quantum thermodynamic devices, and to highlight the commonalities and differences of the various physical situations.}

We reveal that the soft mode fails to describe the characteristics of the criticality. We calculate the critical exponent of the superradiant phase transition and identify an inherent relation to the low-frequency spectral density function of the colored bath. We show that a finite temperature of the colored reservoir does not modify qualitatively this dependence on the spectral density function.}

It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented.

In the absence of coherence between energy levels, exact state transition conditions under thermal operations are known in terms of a mathematical relation called thermo-majorization. But incorporating coherence has turned out to be challenging, even under the relatively tractable model wherein all Gibbs state-preserving quantum channels are included. Here we find a mathematical generalization of thermal operations at low temperatures, "cooling maps", for which we derive the necessary and sufficient state transition condition. Cooling maps that saturate recently-discovered bounds on coherence transfer are realizable as thermal operations, motivating us to conjecture that all cooling maps are thermal operations. Cooling maps, though a less conservative generalization to thermal operations, are more tractable than Gibbs-preserving operations, suggesting that cooling map-like models at general temperatures could be of use in gaining insight about thermal operations.},

  abstract = {Landauer's principle sets a fundamental limit on the heat dissipated when one classical bit of information is erased from a memory, therefore establishing a direct link between information theory and thermodynamics. However, with the advent of quantum technologies, the question of whether there is a strategy to overcome the principle naturally emerges. In this work, we present a quantum channel which erases any qubit state with unit probability, and is capable of operating beyond Landauer's limit. The method is based only on unitary operations, and requires that a non-energetic degree of freedom of the thermal reservoir be preselected into a pure state before interacting with the qubit memory. The violation of the Landauer bound is verified when the reservoir temperature is above a given limit temperature, which can be well below room temperature.},

  abstract = {We present a new technique for computing entanglement harvesting with Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors. The method is particularly useful in cases where analytic solutions are rare and the Wightman function is known only via its mode expansion for which numerical integration can become very expensive. By exploiting the conjugate symmetry of the Wightman function, we may split the integral into parts dependent on the commutator and anticommutator of the field. In cases where the commutator vanishes, such as spacelike separation, or timelike separation if the strong Huygens principle holds, we then show that the entangling term of the bipartite density matrix can be expressed in terms of the much simpler mutual information term. For the vacuum state, this can be translated into a simple Fourier transform, and thus a single sum over modes, simplifying the procurement of closed expressions. We demonstrate this for Minkowski space, finding an analytical solution where none was previously known.}

We establish invariance properties of such a Wick expansion under coordinate changes and the action of a Lie group of symmetries, and we use this to study essential features of path integral manipulations, including coordinate changes, Ward identities, Schwinger-Dyson equations, Faddeev-Popov gauge-fixing, and eliminating fields by their equation of motion. We also discuss the asymptotic nature of the Wick expansion and the implications this has for defining path integrals perturbatively and nonperturbatively.},

  abstract = {Physical systems that power motion and create structure in a fixed amount of time dissipate energy and produce entropy. Whether living or synthetic, systems performing these dynamic functions must balance dissipation and speed. Here, we show that rates of energy and entropy exchange are subject to a speed limit -- a time-information uncertainty relation -- imposed by the rates of change in the information content of the system. This uncertainty relation bounds the time that elapses before the change in a thermodynamic quantity has the same magnitude as its initial standard deviation. From this general bound, we establish a family of speed limits for heat, work, entropy production, and entropy flow depending on the experimental constraints on the system. In all of these inequalities, the time scale of transient dynamical fluctuations is universally bounded by the Fisher information. Moreover, they all have a mathematical form that mirrors the Mandelstam-Tamm version of the time-energy uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics. These bounds on the speed of arbitrary observables apply to transient systems away from thermodynamic equilibrium, independent of the physical assumptions about the stochastic dynamics or their function.},

Recently, the significance of quantum coherence in work extraction has been theoretically identified, revealing that quantum states with more coherence possess more ergotropy compared to their dephased counterparts. However, an experimental study of the coherent ergotropy remains absent. Here, we report an experimental investigation of the coherent ergotropy in a single spin system. Based on the method of measuring ergotropy with an ancilla qubit, both the coherent and incoherent components of the ergotropy for the nonequilibrium state were successfully extracted. The increase in ergotropy induced by the increase in the coherence of the system was observed by varying the coherence of the state. Our work reveals the interplay between quantum thermodynamics and quantum information theory, future investigations could further explore the role other quantum attributes play in thermodynamic protocols.},

The guiding principle behind our approach is that of symmetries and entanglement. We introduce the concept of low-dimensional Gauge-Like Symmetries (GLSs), and the physical conservation laws (including topological terms and fractionalization) which emerge from them. We prove then sufficient conditions for TQO at both zero and finite temperatures. The topological defects which are associated with the restoration of GLSs lead to TQO. Selection rules associated with the GLSs enable us to systematically construct states with TQO; these selection rules do not rely on the existence of a finite gap between the ground states to all other excited states. All currently known examples of TQO display GLSs. We analyze spectral structures and show that Kitaev's toric code model and Wen's plaquette model are equivalent and reduce, by a duality mapping, to an Ising chain. Despite the spectral gap in these systems, the toric operator expectation values may vanish once thermal fluctuations are present. This mapping illustrates that the quantum states themselves in a particular (operator language) representation encode TQO and that the duality mappings, being non-local in the original representation, disentangle the order. We present a general algorithm for the construction of long-range string orders in general systems with entangled ground states.},

  abstract = {Quantum thermodynamics is aimed at grasping thermodynamic laws as they apply to thermal machines operating in the deep quantum regime, where coherence and entanglement are expected to matter. Despite substantial progress, however, it has remained difficult to develop thermal machines in which such quantum effects are observed to be of pivotal importance. In this work, we demonstrate the possibility to experimentally measure and benchmark a genuine quantum correction, induced by quantum friction, to the classical work fluctuation-dissipation relation. This is achieved by combining laser-induced coherent Hamiltonian rotations and energy measurements on a trapped ion. Our results demonstrate that recent developments in stochastic quantum thermodynamics can be used to benchmark and unambiguously distinguish genuine quantum coherent signatures generated along driving protocols, even in presence of experimental SPAM errors and, most importantly, beyond the regimes for which theoretical predictions are available (e.g., in slow driving).},

In this work, we provide an alternative way to calculate the free expansion by recognizing that the Gaussian wavepacket can be thought of as the ground state of a harmonic oscillator with its frequency adjusted to give the initial width of the Gaussian, and the time evolution, given by the free-particle Hamiltonian, being the same as the application of a time-dependent squeezing operator to the harmonic oscillator ground state. Operator manipulations alone (including the Hadamard lemma and the exponential disentangling identity) then allow us to directly solve the problem. As quantum instruction evolves to include more quantum information science applications, reworking this well known problem using a squeezing formalism will help students develop intuition for how squeezed states are used in quantum sensing.},

Inspired by interferometry schemes, we propose a work distribution that generalizes the two-point measurement scheme employed in quantum thermodynamics to the case of quantum fields and avoids the use of projective measurements. The distribution is calculated for local unitary processes performed on Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (thermal) states of scalar fields. Crooks theorem and the Jarzynski equality are shown to be satisfied for a family of spatio-temporally localized unitaries, and some features of the resulting distributions are studied as functions of temperature and the degree of localization of the unitary operation. We show how the work fluctuations become much larger than the average as the process becomes more localized in both time and space.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the following main question: Do we have a theoretical understanding of entanglement applicable to a full variety of physical settings? It is clear that not only the assumption of distinguishability, but also the few-subsystem scenario, are too narrow to embrace all possible physical settings. In particular, the need to go beyond the traditional subsystem-based framework becomes manifest when one tries to apply the conventional concept of entanglement to the physics of matter, since the constituents of a quantum many-body system are indistinguishable particles. We shall discuss here a notion of generalized entanglement, which can be applied to any operator language (fermions, bosons, spins, etc.) used to describe a physical system and which includes the conventional entanglement settings introduced to date in a unified fashion. This is realized by noticing that entanglement is an observer-dependent concept, whose properties are determined by the expectations of a distinguished set of observables without reference to a preferred subsystem decomposition, i.e., it depends on the physically relevant point of view. This viewpoint depends in turn upon the relationship between different sets of observables that determine our ability to control the system of interest. Indeed, the extent to which entanglement is present depends on the observables used to measure a system and describe its states. This represents a most conspicuous advantage as will be highlighted by the condensed-matter application we will discuss.},

An analogous limit for bosonic ancillae is also obtained to show that the lower bound of the error probability is inversely proportional to the average number of photons. Any set of universal gates inevitably obeys a related limitation with error probability O(1/n{\textasciicircum}2)\$. To circumvent the above or related limitations yielded by conservation laws, it is recommended that the computational basis should be chosen as the one commuting with the additively conserved quantities.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments have demonstrated an open system realization of the Dicke quantum phase transition in the motional degrees of freedom of an optically driven Bose-Einstein condensate in a cavity. Relevant collective excitations of this light-matter system are polaritonic in nature, allowing access to the quantum critical behavior of the Dicke model through light leaking out of the cavity. This opens the path to using photodetection based quantum optical techniques to study the dynamics and excitations of this elementary quantum critical system. We first discuss the photon flux observed at the cavity face and find that it displays a different scaling law near criticality than that obtained from the mean field theory for the equivalent closed system. Next, we study the second order correlation measurements of photons leaking out of the cavity. Finally, we discuss a modulation technique that directly captures the softening of polaritonic excitations. Our analysis takes into account the effect of the finite size of the system which may result in an effective symmetry breaking term.}

  abstract = {Quantum Optimal Control (QOC) supports the advance of quantum technologies by tackling its problems at the pulse level: Numerical approaches iteratively work towards a given target by parametrising the applied time-dependent fields with a finite set of variables. The effectiveness of the resulting optimisation depends on the complexity of the problem and the number of variables. We consider different parametrisations in terms of basis functions, asking whether the choice of the applied basis affects the quality of the optimisation. Furthermore, we consider strategies to choose the most suitable basis. For the comparison, we test three different randomisable bases - introducing the sinc and sigmoid bases as alternatives to the Fourier basis - on QOC problems of varying complexity. For each problem, the basis-specific convergence rates result in a unique ranking. Especially for expensive evaluations, e.g., in closed-loop, a potential speed-up by a factor of up to 10 may be crucial for the optimisation's feasibility. We conclude that a problem-dependent basis choice is an influential factor for QOC efficiency and provide advice for its approach.},

  abstract = {The quantum-mechanical and thermodynamic properties of a 3-level molecular cooling cycle are derived. An inadequacy of earlier models is rectified in accounting for the spontaneous emission and absorption associated with the coupling to the coherent driving field via an environmental reservoir. This additional coupling need not be dissipative, and can provide a thermal driving force - the quantum analog of classical absorption chillers. The dependence of the maximum attainable cooling rate on temperature, at ultra-low temperatures, is determined and shown to respect the recently-established fundamental bound based on the second and third laws of thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {In this paper we explore the set of linear maps sending the set of quantum Gaussian states into itself. These maps are in general not positive, a feature which can be exploited as a test to check whether a given quantum state belongs to the convex hull of Gaussian states (if one of the considered maps sends it into a non positive operator, the above state is certified not to belong to the set). Generalizing a result known to be valid under the assumption of complete positivity, we provide a characterization of these Gaussian-to-Gaussian (not necessarily positive) superoperators in terms of their action on the characteristic function of the inputs. For the special case of one-mode mappings we also show that any Gaussian-to-Gaussian superoperator can be expressed as a concatenation of a phase-space dilatation, followed by the action of a completely positive Gaussian channel, possibly composed with a transposition. While a similar decomposition is shown to fail in the multi-mode scenario, we prove that it still holds at least under the further hypothesis of homogeneous action on the covariance matrix.},

  abstract = {The Gouy phase, sometimes called the phase anomaly, is the remarkable effect that in the region of focus a converging wave field undergoes a rapid phase change by an amount of {$\pi$}, compared to the phase of a plane wave of the same frequency. This phenomenon plays a crucial role in any application where fields are focused, such as optical coherence tomography, mode selection in laser resonators, and interference microscopy. However, when the field is spatially partially coherent, as is often the case, its phase is a random quantity. When such a field is focused, the Gouy phase is therefore undefined. The correlation properties of partially coherent fields are described by their so-called spectral degree of coherence. We demonstrate that this coherence function does exhibit a generalized Gouy phase. Its precise behavior in the focal region depends on the transverse coherence length. We show that this effect influences the fringe spacing in interference experiments in a nontrivial manner.}

In: Directions in general relativity: proceedings of the 1993 International Symposium, Maryland, vol~2, pp 293--305, 1993) and Borsten et al. (Phys Rev D 104(2), 2021. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.025012) establish that a natural extension of quantum measurement theory from non-relativistic quantum mechanics to relativistic quantum theory leads to the unacceptable consequence that expectation values in one region depend on which unitary operation is performed in a spacelike separated region. Sorkin [1] labels such scenarios `impossible measurements'. We explicitly present these arguments as a no-go result with the logical form of a reductio argument and investigate the consequences for measurement in quantum field theory (QFT). Sorkin-type impossible measurement scenarios clearly illustrate the moral that Microcausality is not by itself sufficient to rule out superluminal signalling in relativistic quantum theories that use L{\"u}ders' rule. We review three different approaches to formulating an account of measurement for QFT and analyze their responses to the `impossible measurements' problem. Two of the approaches are: a measurement theory based on detector models proposed in Polo-G{\'o}mez et al. (Phys Rev D, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevd.105.065003) and a measurement framework for algebraic QFT proposed in Fewster and Verch (Commun Math Phys 378(2):851--889, 2020). Of particular interest for foundations of QFT is that they share common features that may hold general morals about how to represent measurement in QFT. These morals are about the role that dynamics plays in eliminating `impossible measurements', the abandonment of the operational interpretation of local algebras \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{A\}\}(O)\$\$as representing possible operations carried out in region O, and the interpretation of state update rules. Finally, we examine the form that the `impossible measurements' problem takes in histories-based approaches and we discuss the remaining challenges.},

  abstract = {Pointlike systems coupled to quantum fields are often employed as toy models for measurements in quantum field theory. In this paper, we identify the field observables recorded by such models. We show that in models that work in the strong coupling regime, the apparatus is correlated with smeared field amplitudes, while in models that work in weak coupling the apparatus records particle aspects of the field, such as the existence of a particle-like time of arrival and resonant absorption. Then, we develop an improved field-detector interaction model, adapting the formalism of Quantum Brownian motion, that is exactly solvable. This model confirms the association of field and particle properties in the strong and weak coupling regimes, respectively. Further, it can also describe the intermediate regime, in which the field-particle characteristics `merge'. In contrast to standard perturbation techniques, this model also recovers the relativistic Breit-Wigner resonant behavior in the weak coupling regime. The modulation of field-particle-duality by a single tunable parameter is a novel feature that is, in principle, experimentally accessible.},

  abstract = {Application of multiple rounds of Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is an essential milestone towards the construction of scalable quantum information processing devices. However, experimental realizations of it are still in their infancy. The requirements for multiple round QEC are high control fidelity and the ability to extract entropy from ancilla qubits. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) based quantum devices have demonstrated high control fidelity with up to 12 qubits. On the other hand, the major challenge in the NMR QEC experiment is to efficiently supply ancilla qubits in highly pure states at the beginning of each round of QEC. Purification of qubits in NMR, or in other ensemble based quantum systems can be accomplished through Heat Bath Algorithmic Cooling (HBAC). It is an efficient method for extracting entropy from qubits that interact with a heat bath, allowing cooling below the bath temperature. For practical HBAC, coupled electron-nuclear spin systems are more promising than conventional NMR quantum processors, since electron spin polarization is about \$10{\textasciicircum}3\$ times greater than that of a proton under the same experimental conditions. We provide an overview on both theoretical and experimental aspects of HBAC focusing on spin and magnetic resonance based systems, and discuss the prospects of exploiting electron-nuclear coupled systems for the realization of HBAC and multiple round QEC.},

More recently, this historically theoretical pursuit has become relevant in practical situations where information is manipulated at small scales, such as in molecular and cell biology, artificial nano-devices or quantum computation.

  abstract = {Cavity optomechanical systems are a paradigmatic setting for the conversion of electromagnetic energy into mechanical work. Experiments with atoms coupled to cavity modes are realized in nonequilibrium conditions, described by phenomenological models encoding non-thermal dissipative dynamics and falling outside the framework of weak system-bath couplings. This fact makes their interpretation as quantum engines, e.g., the derivation of a well-defined efficiency, quite challenging. Here, we present a consistent thermodynamic description of open quantum cavity-atom systems. Our approach takes advantage of their nonequilibrium nature and arrives at an energetic balance which is fully interpretable in terms of persistent dissipated heat currents. The interaction between atoms and cavity modes can further give rise to nonequilibrium phase transitions and emergent behavior and allows to assess the impact of collective many-body phenomena on the engine operation. To enable this, we define two thermodynamic limits related to a weak and to a strong optomechanical coupling, respectively. We illustrate our ideas focussing on a time-crystal engine and discuss power generation, energy-conversion efficiency, and emergence of metastable behavior in both limits.},

Only one such map is required for the special case of no initial correlations. The same maps describe the dynamics of any system-environment state obtained from the initial state by a local operation on the system. The reduction of the system dynamics to a set of completely positive maps allows known numerical and analytic tools for uncorrelated initial states to be applied to the general case of initially correlated states, which we exemplify by solving the qubit dephasing model for such states, and provides a natural approach to quantum Markovianity for this case. We show that this set of completely positive maps can be experimentally characterised using only local operations on the system, via a generalisation of noise spectroscopy protocols. As further applications, we first consider the problem of retrodicting the dynamics of an open quantum system which is in an arbitrary state when it becomes accessible to the experimenter, and explore the conditions under which retrodiction is possible. We also introduce a related one-sided or limited-access tomography protocol for determining an arbitrary bipartite state, evolving under a sufficiently rich Hamiltonian, via local operations and measurements on just one component. We simulate this protocol for a physical model of particular relevance to nitrogen-vacancy centres, and in particular show how to reconstruct the density matrix of a set of three qubits, interacting via dipolar coupling and in the presence of local magnetic fields, by measuring and controlling only one of them.},

  abstract = {The detection of the quantum nature of gravity in the low-energy limit hinges on achieving an unprecedented degree of force sensitivity with mechanical systems. Against this background, we explore the relationship between the sensitivity of mechanical systems to external forces and the properties of the quantum states they are prepared in. We establish that the main determinant of the force sensitivity in pure quantum states is their spatial delocalisation and we link the force sensitivity to the rate at which two mechanical systems become entangled under a quantum force. We exemplify this at the hand of two commonly considered configurations. One that involves gravitationally interacting objects prepared in non-Gaussian states such as Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger-cat states, where the generation of entanglement is typically ascribed to the accumulation of a dynamical phase between components in superposition. The other prepares particles in Gaussian states that are strongly squeezed in momentum and delocalised in position where entanglement generation is attributed to accelerations. We offer a unified description of these two arrangements using the phase-space representation and link their entangling rate to their force sensitivity, showing that both configurations get entangled at the same rate provided that they are equally delocalised in space. Our description in phase space and the established relation between force sensitivity and entanglement sheds light on the intricacies of why the equivalence between these two configurations holds, something that is not always evident in the literature, due to the distinct physical and analytical methods employed to study each of them. Notably, we demonstrate that while the conventional computation of entanglement via the dynamical phase remains accurate for Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger-cat states, it yields erroneous estimations for systems in squeezed cat states.},

  abstract = {The principle of covariance, a cornerstone of modern physics, asserts the equivalence of all inertial frames of reference. Fluctuation theorems, as extensions of the second law of thermodynamics, establish universal connections between irreversibility and fluctuation in terms of stochastic thermodynamic quantities. However, these relations typically assume that both the thermodynamic system and the heat bath are at rest with respect to the observer, thereby failing to satisfy the principle of covariance. In this Letter, by introducing covariant work and heat that incorporate both energy-related and momentum-related components, we promote fluctuation theorems into covariant forms applicable to moving thermodynamic systems and moving heat baths. We illustrate this framework with two examples: the work statistics of a relativistic stochastic field and the heat statistics of a relativistic Brownian motion. Although our Letter is carried out in the context of special relativity, the results can be extended to the nonrelativistic limit. Our Letter combines the principle of covariance and fluctuation theorems into a coherent framework and may have applications in the study of thermodynamics relevant to cosmic microwave background as well as the radiative heat transfer and noncontact friction between relatively moving bodies.}

For moving inertial observers relative to the heat bath, both the energy components and the momentum components of work and heat must be included to formulate the corresponding fluctuation theorems, and the four-velocity of the heat bath plays an important role. It turns out that, the irreversibility is characterized by the conventional thermodynamic quantities in the rest reference frame of the heat bath, regardless of the reference frame of the observer. Even in the nonrelativistic case, the above identification is nontrivial.

Striking examples are the Mpemba effect and the cooling-heating asymmetry. These anomalous behaviors can be exploited to shorten the time needed to cool down (or heat up) a system. Though, a strategy to design these effects in mesoscopic systems is missing. We bring forward a description that allows us to formulate such strategies, and, along the way, makes natural these paradoxical behaviors. In particular, we study the evolution of macroscopic physical observables of systems freely relaxing under the influence of one or two instantaneous thermal quenches. The two crucial ingredients in our approach are timescale separation and a nonmonotonic temperature evolution of an important state function. We argue that both are generic features near a first-order transition.

  abstract = {An open question of fundamental importance in thermodynamics is how to describe the fluctuations of work for quantum coherent processes. In the standard approach, based on a projective energy measurement both at the beginning and at the end of the process, the first measurement destroys any initial coherence in the energy basis. Here we seek for extensions of this approach which can possibly account for initially coherent states. We consider all measurement schemes to estimate work and require that (i) the difference of average energy corresponds to average work for closed quantum systems, and that (ii) the work statistics agree with the standard two-measurement scheme for states with no coherence in the energy basis. We first show that such a scheme cannot exist. Next, we consider the possibility of performing collective measurements on several copies of the state and prove that it is still impossible to satisfy simultaneously requirements (i) and (ii). Nevertheless, improvements do appear, and in particular we develop a measurement scheme which acts simultaneously on two copies of the state and allows to describe a whole class of coherent transformations.},

Indeed, we seek to establish and analyze different rankings for programming languages based on their energy efficiency. The goal of being able to rank programming languages based on their energy efficiency is both recent, and certainly deserves further studies. We have taken rigorous and strict solutions to 10 well defined programming problems, expressed in (up to) 27 programming languages, from the well known Computer Language Benchmark Game repository. This repository aims to compare programming languages based on a strict set of implementation rules and configurations for each benchmarking problem. We have also built a framework to automatically, and systematically, run, measure and compare the energy, time, and memory efficiency of such solutions. Ultimately, it is based on such comparisons that we propose a series of efficiency rankings, based on single and multiple criteria. Our results show interesting findings, such as how slower/faster languages can consume less/more energy, and how memory usage influences energy consumption. We also present a simple way to use our results to provide software engineers and practitioners support in deciding which language to use when energy efficiency is a concern. In addition, we further validate our results and rankings against implementations from a chrestomathy program repository, Rosetta Code., by reproducing our methodology and benchmarking system. This allows us to understand how the results and conclusions from our rigorously and well defined benchmarked programs compare to those based on more representative and real-world implementations. Indeed our results show that the rankings do not change apart from one programming language.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the intimate relationship between quantum mechanics, information theory, and relativity theory. Taken together these are the foundations of present-day theoretical physics, and their interrelationship is an essential part of the theory. The acquisition of information from a quantum system by an observer occurs at the interface of classical and quantum physics. The authors review the essential tools needed to describe this interface, i.e., Kraus matrices and positive-operator-valued measures. They then discuss how special relativity imposes severe restrictions on the transfer of information between distant systems and the implications of the fact that quantum entropy is not a Lorentz-covariant concept. This leads to a discussion of how it comes about that Lorentz transformations of reduced density matrices for entangled systems may not be completely positive maps. Quantum field theory is, of course, necessary for a consistent description of interactions. Its structure implies a fundamental tradeoff between detector reliability and localizability. Moreover, general relativity produces new and counterintuitive effects, particularly when black holes (or, more generally, event horizons) are involved. In this more general context the authors discuss how most of the current concepts in quantum information theory may require a reassessment.}

However, thermalization typically requires a large system size due to incorporating a thermal bath, whilst limited resources of near-term digital quantum processors allow for simulating relatively small systems. We show that thermal observables and fluctuations may be obtained for a small closed system without a thermal bath. Thermal observables occur upon classically averaging quantum mechanical observables over randomized variants of their time evolution that run independently on a digital quantum processor. Using an IBM quantum computer, we experimentally find thermal occupation probabilities with finite positive and negative temperatures defined by the initial state's energy. Averaging over random evolutions facilitates error mitigation, with the noise contributing to the temperature in the simulated observables. This result fosters probing the dynamical emergence of equilibrium properties of matter at finite temperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.},

Moreover, atoms can couple strongly to external forces and light fields, which makes them ideal for ultra-precise sensing and time keeping. All these factors call for generating non-classical atomic states designed for phase estimation in atomic clocks and atom interferometers, exploiting many-body entanglement to increase the sensitivity of precision measurements.

  abstract = {Quantum thermalization describes how closed quantum systems can effectively reach thermal equilibrium, resolving the apparent incongruity between the reversibility of Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger's equation and the irreversible entropy growth dictated by the second law of thermodynamics. Despite its ubiquity and conceptual significance, a complete proof of quantum thermalization has remained elusive for several decades. Here, we prove that quantum thermalization must occur in any qubit system with local interactions satisfying three conditions: (i) high effective temperature, (ii) translation invariance, and (iii) no perfect resonances in the energy spectrum. Specifically, we show that a typical, initially unentangled pure state drawn from any ensemble with maximum entropy becomes locally indistinguishable from a Gibbs state upon unitary evolution. Our proof relies on a recent breakthrough in quantum information theory proving the separability of high-temperature thermal states, as well as on new technical results identifying sufficient conditions for quantum thermalization, whose applicability extends beyond our main result. Our work illustrates that statistical physics can be understood as an emergent phenomenon, explicitly derived from the first principles of quantum mechanics.},

Our protocol includes multiple probes, that are not interacting, nor are they initially correlated to each other. They interact with a Bosonic sample and reach a non-equilibrium steady state, which is measured to estimate the temperature of the sample. It is well-known that in the steady state such non-interacting probes may get correlated to each other and even entangled. Nonetheless, the impact of these correlations in metrology has not been deeply investigated yet. Here, we examine their role for thermometry of cold Bosonic gases and show that, although being classical, bath-induced correlations can indeed lead to sub-shot-noise precision for thermometry at low temperatures; e.g., for a probe of \$30\$ non-interacting impurities they can enhance the quantum Fisher information by two orders of magnitude. The proposed thermometry scheme here does not require precise dynamical control of the probes and tuning the parameters, as it is build upon the non-equilibrium steady state of a non-interacting system. Our results put forward new possibilities in thermometry at low temperatures, of relevance for instance in cold gases and Bose--Einstein condensates.},

The quantum simulation of Lindbladian dynamics is therefore non-unitary, preventing a naive application of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. Here, we make use of an approximate correspondence between Lindbladian dynamics and evolution based on repeated interaction (RI) CPTP maps to write down a Hamiltonian formulation of the Lindblad dynamics and derive a rigorous error bound on the master equation.

Using an information-theoretic approach, we provide a relativistic analogue to the quantum mechanical L\${\textbackslash}backslash\$"uders update rule to update the field state following the measurement on the detector. We argue that this proposal has all the desirable characteristics of a proper measurement theory. In particular it does not suffer from the "impossible measurements" problem pointed out by Rafael Sorkin in the 90s which shows that idealized measurements cannot be used in quantum field theory.}

The standard methods such as gauge-fixing and Faddeev-Popov ghosts are also included. Resulting Feynman diagram series often may be used rigorously without any references to the initial physical theory (which one may "sweep under the carpet"). This idea is illustrated on an example of the Chern-Simons theory, which leads to universal finite type invariants of knots and 3-manifolds.},

In this paper, we describe these codes in the stabilizer formalism of standard quantum error correction theory. This is achieved by adding a "gauge" group to the standard stabilizer definition of a code that defines an equivalence class between encoded states. Gauge transformations leave the encoded information unchanged; their effect is absorbed by virtual gauge qubits that do not carry useful information. We illustrate the construction by identifying a gauge symmetry in Shor's 9-qubit code that allows us to remove 4 of its 8 stabilizer generators, leading to a simpler decoding procedure and a wider class of logical operations without affecting its essential properties. This opens the path to possible improvements of the error threshold of fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

We show that, under certain circumstances, relaxing previous idealizations makes vacuum entanglement harvesting more efficient.}

  abstract = {Theoretical accounts of ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems commonly assume that it arises from the interaction of an emitter with propagating photon modes supported by a structure, understanding photons as the excitations of the transverse electromagnetic field. This description discards the Coulomb interaction between the emitter and structure charges. Here, we show with a general argument based on electromagnetic constraints that the emitter-photon coupling strength is fundamentally limited. Accordingly, we conclude that the ultrastrong coupling regime cannot be reached with photons. Instead, it must originate from the Coulomb interactions between charges. A further corollary is that the so-called polarization self-energy term does not need to be included. We illustrate our claims by solving an analytical model of the paradigmatic case of an emitter next to a metallic nanosphere. These findings shed light on the fundamental processes underlying ultrastrong coupling, clarify the role of the polarization self-energy term and compel a reevaluation of previous literature.},

  abstract = {Quantum simulation of many-body systems, particularly using ultracold atoms and trapped ions, presents a unique form of quantum control---it is a direct implementation of a multi-qubit gate generated by the Hamiltonian. As a consequence, it also faces a unique challenge in terms of benchmarking, because the well-established gate benchmarking techniques are unsuitable for this form of quantum control. Here we show that the symmetries of the target many-body Hamiltonian can be used not only to benchmark but to characterize experimental errors in the quantum simulation. We use our results to develop protocols to characterize these errors, which can be implemented using state-of-the-art technology. We consider two forms of errors: (i) unitary errors arising out of systematic errors in the applied Hamiltonian and (ii) canonical non-Markovian errors arising out of random shot-to-shot fluctuations in the applied Hamiltonian. We show that the dynamics of the expectation value of the target Hamiltonian itself, which is ideally constant in time, can be used to characterize these errors. In the presence of errors, the expectation value of the target Hamiltonian shows a characteristic thermalization dynamics, when it satisfies the operator thermalization hypothesis (OTH). That is, an oscillation in the short time followed by relaxation to a steady-state value in the long time limit. We show that while the steady-state value can be used to characterize the coherent errors, the amplitude of the oscillations can be used to estimate the non-Markovian errors. We prove a sandwich theorem to establish a linear relation between the amplitude of the oscillations and the magnitude of the non-Markovian errors. Moreover, by varying the initial state, we show that the steady state values can be used to completely construct the generator of the coherent errors. Using these results, we develop two experimental protocols to characterize the unitary errors based on these results, one of which requires single-qubit addressing and the other one doesn't. We also develop a protocol to characterize non-Markovian errors.}

  abstract = {Time estimation is a fundamental task that underpins precision measurement, global navigation systems, financial markets, and the organisation of everyday life. Many biological processes also depend on time estimation by nanoscale clocks, whose performance can be significantly impacted by random fluctuations. In this work, we formulate the problem of optimal time estimation for Markovian stochastic processes, and present its general solution in the asymptotic (long-time) limit. Specifically, we obtain a tight upper bound on the precision of any time estimate constructed from sustained observations of a classical, Markovian jump process. This bound is controlled by the mean residual time, i.e. the expected wait before the first jump is observed. As a consequence, we obtain a universal bound on the signal-to-noise ratio of arbitrary currents and counting observables in the steady state. This bound is similar in spirit to the kinetic uncertainty relation but provably tighter, and we explicitly construct the counting observables that saturate it. Our results establish ultimate precision limits for an important class of observables in non-equilibrium systems, and demonstrate that the mean residual time, not the dynamical activity, is the measure of freneticity that tightly constrains fluctuations far from equilibrium.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamics of a qubit system interacting with thermalized bath-ancilla spins via a repeated interaction scheme. Considering generic initial conditions for the system and employing a Heisenberg-type interaction between the system and the ancillas, we analytically prove the following: (i) The population and coherences of the system qubit evolve independently toward a nonequilibrium steady-state solution, which is diagonal in the qubit's energy eigenbasis. The population relaxes to this state geometrically, whereas the coherences decay through a more compound behavior. (ii) In the long time limit, the system approaches a steady state that generally differs from the thermal state of the ancilla. We derive this steady-state solution and show its dependence on the interaction parameters and collision frequency. (iii) We bound the number of interaction steps required to achieve the steady state within a specified error tolerance, and we evaluate the energetic cost associated with the process. Our key finding is that deterministic system-ancilla interactions do not typically result in the system thermalizing to the thermal state of the ancilla. Instead, they generate a distinct nonequilibrium steady state, which we explicitly derive. However, we also identify an operational regime that leads to thermalization with a few long and possibly randomized collisions.},

  abstract = {As previously demonstrated, the entropy production -- a key quantity characterizing the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes -- is related to generation of correlations between degrees of freedom of the system and its thermal environment. This raises the question of whether such correlations are of a classical or quantum nature, namely, whether they are accessible through local measurements on the correlated degrees of freedom. We address this problem by considering fermionic and bosonic Gaussian systems. We show that for fermions the entropy production is mostly quantum due to the parity superselection rule which restricts the set of physically allowed measurements to projections on the Fock states, thus significantly limiting the amount of classically accessible correlations. In contrast, in bosonic systems a much larger amount of correlations can be accessed through Gaussian measurements. Specifically, while the quantum contribution may be important at low temperatures, in the high temperature limit the entropy production corresponds to purely classical position-momentum correlations. Our results demonstrate an important difference between fermionic and bosonic systems regarding the existence of a quantum-to-classical transition in the microscopic formulation of the entropy production. They also show that entropy production can be mainly caused by quantum correlations even in the weak coupling limit, which admits a description in terms of classical rate equations for state populations, as well as in the low particle density limit, where the transport properties of both bosons and fermions converge to those of classical particles.},

  abstract = {Hybrid quantum systems seek to combine the strength of its constituents to master the fundamental conflicting requirements of quantum technology: fast and accurate systems control together with perfect shielding from the environment, including the measurements apparatus, to achieve long quantum coherence. Excellent examples for hybrid quantum systems are heterogeneous spin systems where electron spins are used for readout and control while nuclear spins are used as long-lived quantum bits. Here we show that joint initialization, projective readout and fast local and non-local gate operations are no longer conflicting requirements in those systems, even under ambient conditions. We demonstrate high-fidelity initialization of a whole spin register (99 \%) and single-shot readout of multiple individual nuclear spins by using the ancillary electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond. Implementation of a novel non-local gate generic to our hybrid electron-nuclear quantum register allows to prepare entangled states of three nuclear spins, with fidelities exceeding 85 \%. An important tool for scalable quantum computation is quantum error correction. Combining, for the first time, optimal-control based error avoidance with error correction, we realize a three-qubit phase-flip error correction algorithm. Utilizing optimal control, all of the above algorithms achieve fidelities approaching fault tolerant quantum operation, thus paving the way to large scale integrations. Our techniques can be used to improve scaling of quantum networks relying on diamond spins, phosphorous in silicon or other spin systems like quantum dots, silicon carbide or rare earth ions in solids.},

Based on these results the quantum versions of both the Carnot heat engine and the Otto heat engine are defined without ambiguities. We also study the properties of quantum Carnot and Otto heat engines in comparison with their classical counterparts. Relations and mappings between these two quantum heat engines are also investigated by considering their respective quantum thermodynamic processes. In addition, we discuss the role of Maxwell's demon in quantum thermodynamic cycles. We find that there is no violation of the second law, even in the existence of such a demon, when the demon is included correctly as part of the working substance of the heat engine.},

We use the energy surface minimization method to demonstrate that the extended Dicke model exhibits a quantum phase transition, and we analyse its dependence upon the maximum number of excitations of the model. Our analysis is carried out via three methods: through mean-field analysis (i.e. by using the tensor product of coherent states), by using parity-preserving symmetry-adapted states (using the critical values obtained in the mean-field analysis and numerically minimizing the energy surface) and by means of the exact quantum solution (i.e. by numerically diagonalizing the Hamiltonian).

Many parameter combinations can vary over decades without significant changes in the predictions. This review uses information geometry to explore sloppiness and its deep relation to emergent theories. We introduce the model manifold of predictions, whose coordinates are the model parameters. Its hyperribbon structure explains why only a few parameter combinations matter for the behavior. We review recent rigorous results that connect the hierarchy of hyperribbon widths to approximation theory, and to the smoothness of model predictions under changes of the control variables. We discuss recent geodesic methods to find simpler models on nearby boundaries of the model manifold---emergent theories with fewer parameters that explain the behavior equally well. We discuss a Bayesian prior which optimizes the mutual information between model parameters and experimental data, naturally favoring points on the emergent boundary theories and thus simpler models. We introduce a `projected maximum likelihood' prior that efficiently approximates this optimal prior, and contrast both to the poor behavior of the traditional Jeffreys prior. We discuss the way the renormalization group coarse-graining in statistical mechanics introduces a flow of the model manifold, and connect stiff and sloppy directions along the model manifold with relevant and irrelevant eigendirections of the renormalization group. Finally, we discuss recently developed `intensive' embedding methods, allowing one to visualize the predictions of arbitrary probabilistic models as low-dimensional projections of an isometric embedding, and illustrate our method by generating the model manifold of the Ising model.},

Here, we present a tutorial for how the quantum dynamics of systems can be solved using a Lie-algebra decoupling method. The approach involves identifying a Lie algebra that governs the dynamics of the system, enabling the derivation of differential equations to solve the Schr{\"o}dinger equation. As background, we include an overview of Lie groups and Lie algebras aimed at a general-physicist audience. We then prove the Lie-algebra decoupling theorem and apply it to both closed and open dynamics. The results represent a broad methodology to find the dynamics of quantum systems with applications across many fields of modern quantum research.},

We also show that our new technique converges to the asymptotic state of HBAC and that the cooling algorithm can be efficiently implemented; however, the saturation could require exponentially many iterations and remains impractical. This brings HBAC to the realm of feasibility and makes it a viable option for realistic application in quantum technologies.},

  abstract = {Variational quantum computing schemes have received considerable attention due to their high versatility and potential to make practical use of near-term quantum devices. At their core, these models train a loss function by sending an initial state through a parametrized quantum circuit, and evaluating the expectation value of some operator at the circuit's output. Despite their promise, the trainablity of these algorithms is hindered by barren plateaus induced by the expressiveness of the parametrized quantum circuit, the entanglement of the input data, the locality of the observable, or the presence of hardware noise. Up to this point, these sources of barren plateaus have been regarded as independent and have been studied only for specific circuit architectures. In this work, we present a general Lie algebraic theory that provides an exact expression for the variance of the loss function of sufficiently deep parametrized quantum circuits, even in the presence of certain noise models. Our results unify under one single framework all aforementioned sources of barren plateaus by leveraging generalized (and subsystem independent) notions of entanglement and operator locality, as well as generalized notions of algebraic decoherence due to noise. This theoretical leap resolves a standing conjecture about a connection between loss concentration and the dimension of the Lie algebra of the generators of the parametrized circuit.},

Unlike existing work on detecting violations of Gauss' law, our circuits are fault tolerant and the overall error correction scheme outperforms a na{\"i}ve application of the [5,\,1,\,3] code. The constructions outlined can be extended to LGT systems with larger cutoffs and may be of use in understanding how to hybridize error correction and quantum simulation for LGTs in higher space-time dimensions and with different symmetry groups.},

As a case study, we focus on a three-level system and analyze its dynamics in two complementary regimes, where the system-ancilla interaction strength is either large or small. Focusing on the estimation of the simulation time, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum number of collisions, or minimal simulation time, required to achieve a thermal state, which is within \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ distance to the target thermal state. At zero temperature, we analytically identify a set of points (interaction strength \${\textbackslash}times\$ their duration) that minimize the simulation time. At nonzero temperature, we observe a Mpemba-like effect: Starting from a maximally mixed state, thermalization to an intermediate-temperature state takes longer than to a lower-temperature one. We provide an accurate analytical approximation for this phenomenon and demonstrate its occurrence in larger systems and under randomized interaction strengths. The prevalence of the Mpemba effect in thermal state preparation presents a significant challenge for preparing states in large systems, an open problem calling for new strategies.},

  abstract = {This tutorial aims at giving an introductory treatment of the circuit analysis of superconducting qubits, i.e., two-level systems in superconducting circuits. It also touches upon couplings between such qubits and how microwave driving and these couplings can be used for single- and two-qubit gates, as well as how to include noise when calculating the dynamics of the system. We also discuss higher-dimensional superconducting qudits. The tutorial is intended for new researchers with limited or no experience with the field but should be accessible to anyone with a bachelor's degree in physics. The tutorial introduces the basic methods used in quantum circuit analysis, starting from a circuit diagram and ending with a quantized Hamiltonian, that may be truncated to the lowest levels. We provide examples of all the basic techniques throughout the discussion, while in the last part of the tutorial we discuss several of the most commonly used circuits for quantum-information applications. This includes both worked examples of single qubits and examples of how to analyze the coupling methods that allow multiqubit operations. In several detailed appendices, we provide the interested reader with an introduction to more advanced techniques for handling larger circuit designs.},

They are temporal counterparts to transverse spatial modes of light and play analogous roles - decomposing multimode light into the most natural basis for isolating statistically independent degrees of freedom. We discuss how TMs were developed to describe compactly various processes: superfluorescence, stimulated Raman scattering, spontaneous parametric down conversion, and spontaneous four-wave mixing. TMs can be manipulated, converted, demultiplexed, and detected using nonlinear optical processes such as three-wave mixing and quantum optical memories. As such, they play an increasingly important role in constructing quantum information networks.},

We provide a simple and rigorous proof of an improved version of the Principle, which is formulated in terms of an equality rather than an inequality. The proof is based on quantum statistical mechanics concepts rather than on thermodynamic argumentation. From this equality version, we obtain explicit improvements of Landauer's bound that depend on the effective size of the thermal reservoir and reduce to Landauer's bound only for infinite-sized reservoirs.},

The methods are illustrated on a wide range of current research topics such as the design of nanoscale coherent light sources, highly-reflective quantum metasurfaces or low intracavity power superradiant lasers. The analytical approaches are developed for ensembles of identical two-level quantum emitters and then extended to more complex systems where frequency disorder or vibronic couplings are taken into account. The relevance of the approach ranges from atoms in optical lattices to quantum dots or molecular systems in solid-state environments.},

Alice and Bob's operations may commute, in the sense that the joint input-output behaviour is independent of the order in which they access \$K\$. Here we ask whether this commutation property implies that \$K\$ can be split into two factors on which Alice and Bob act separately. The question can be regarded as a "fully quantum" generalisation of a problem posed by Tsirelson, who considered the case where Alice and Bob's inputs and outputs are classical. In this case, the answer is negative in general, but it is known that a factorisation exists in finite dimensions. Here we show the same holds in the fully quantum case, i.e., commuting operations factorise, provided that all input systems are finite-dimensional.},

We find qualitative differences between the calculations of complexity from spatial volume and action (CV and CA). In the CV calculation, the complexity for antiperiodic boundary conditions is smaller than for periodic, and decreases monotonically with increasing IR scale. In the CA calculation, the complexity for antiperiodic boundary conditions is larger than for periodic, and initially increases with increasing IR scale, eventually decreasing to zero as the IR scale becomes of order the UV cutoff.

  abstract = {Physical theories are developed to describe phenomena in particular regimes, and generally are valid only within a limited range of scales. For example, general relativity provides an effective description of the Universe at large length scales, and has been tested from the cosmic scale down to distances as small as 10 meters. In contrast, quantum theory provides an effective description of physics at small length scales. Direct tests of quantum theory have been performed at the smallest probeable scales at the Large Hadron Collider, \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\} 10{\textasciicircum}\{-20\}\$ meters, up to that of hundreds of kilometers. Yet, such tests fall short of the scales required to investigate potentially significant physics that arises at the intersection of quantum and relativistic regimes. We propose to push direct tests of quantum theory to larger and larger length scales, approaching that of the radius of curvature of spacetime, where we begin to probe the interaction between gravity and quantum phenomena. In particular, we review a wide variety of potential tests of fundamental physics that are conceivable with artificial satellites in Earth orbit and elsewhere in the solar system, and attempt to sketch the magnitudes of potentially observable effects. The tests have the potential to determine the applicability of quantum theory at larger length scales, eliminate various alternative physical theories, and place bounds on phenomenological models motivated by ideas about spacetime microstructure from quantum gravity. From a more pragmatic perspective, as quantum communication technologies such as quantum key distribution advance into Space towards large distances, some of the fundamental physical effects discussed here may need to be taken into account to make such schemes viable.},

  abstract = {We review one of the most versatile theoretical approaches to the study of time-dependent correlated quantum transport in nano-systems: the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. Within this formalism, one can treat, on the same footing, inter-particle interactions, external drives and/or perturbations, and coupling to baths with a (piece-wise) continuum set of degrees of freedom. After a historical overview on the theory of transport in quantum systems, we present a modern introduction of the NEGF approach to quantum transport. We discuss the inclusion of inter-particle interactions using diagrammatic techniques, and the use of the so-called embedding and inbedding techniques which take the bath couplings into account non-perturbatively. In various limits, such as the non-interacting limit and the steady-state limit, we then show how the NEGF formalism elegantly reduces to well-known formulae in quantum transport as special cases. We then discuss non-equilibrium transport in general, for both particle and energy currents. Under the presence of a time-dependent drive - encompassing pump-probe scenarios as well as driven quantum systems - we discuss the transient as well as asymptotic behavior, and also how to use NEGF to infer information on the out-of-equilibrium system. As illustrative examples, we consider model systems general enough to pave the way to realistic systems. These examples encompass one- and two-dimensional electronic systems, systems with electron-phonon couplings, topological superconductors, and optically responsive molecular junctions where electron-photon couplings are relevant.},

This area law is well established in flat space, where it follows almost directly from dimensional arguments. We study its validity in an Einstein universe, whose curvature provides an additional physical parameter on which the entropy could, in principle, depend. The surprisingly simple result is that the entanglement entropy still scales linearly with the area. This is supported by other observations to the effect that the entanglement entropy arises mostly from degrees of freedom near the boundary, making it insensitive to the large-scale geometry of the background space.},

  abstract = {Describing open quantum systems far from equilibrium is challenging, in particular when the environment is mesoscopic, when it develops nonequilibrium features during the evolution, or when the memory effects cannot be disregarded. Here, we derive a master equation that explicitly accounts for system-bath correlations and includes, at a coarse-grained level, a dynamically evolving bath. Such a master equation applies to a wide variety of physical systems including those described by Random Matrix Theory or the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. We obtain a local detailed balance condition which, interestingly, does not forbid the emergence of stable negative temperature states in unison with the definition of temperature through the Boltzmann entropy. We benchmark the master equation against the exact evolution and observe a very good agreement in a situation where the conventional Born-Markov-secular master equation breaks down. Interestingly, the present description of the dynamics is robust and it remains accurate even if some of the assumptions are relaxed. Even though our master equation describes a dynamically evolving bath not described by a Gibbs state, we provide a consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic framework and derive the first and second law as well as the Clausius inequality. Our work paves the way for studying a variety of nanoscale quantum technologies including engines, refrigerators, or heat pumps beyond the conventionally employed assumption of a static thermal bath.},

Realization of the quantum Maxwell's demon remains of actual interest given the potential of continuous-variable systems in quantum thermodynamics and current experimental opportunities. We propose a quantum Maxwell's demon method, based on a Jaynes-Cummings two-level system, for subtracting bosonic energy inferred from successful measurements of excited qubits after linear and nonlinear interactions. The effect of these subtractions can suppress the tails of bosonic noise better than the linear interactions alone. The system statistics reaches an out-of-equilibrium state, becoming much closer to Poissonian distributions as indicated by the mean-to-noise ratio. The inclusion of a few additional optimal nonlinear subtractions can improve the success rate to ten times higher than the linear scheme, making the method significantly more efficient in exciting hundreds of qubits.},

Physically, this is a symmetry algebra for the interaction Hamiltonian. This paper begins a systematic study of channels defined by representations; the famous Werner-Holevo channel is one element of this infinite class. We show that the channel derived from the defining representation of SU(n) is a depolarizing channel for all \$n\$, but for most other representations this is not the case. Since the Bloch sphere is not appropriate here, we develop technology which is a generalization of Bloch's technique. Our method works by representing the density matrix as a polynomial in symmetrized products of Lie algebra generators, with coefficients that are symmetric tensors. Using these tensor methods we prove eleven theorems, derive many explicit formulas and show other interesting properties of quantum channels in various dimensions, with various Lie symmetry algebras. We also derive numerical estimates on the size of a generalized ``Bloch sphere'' for certain channels. There remain many open questions which are indicated at various points through the paper.},

We show that, in the continuous-time limit, the model allows for a clear formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, which are modified to include a non-trivial contribution related to quantum coherence. Remarkably, we derive a bound showing that the degree of such coherence in the state of the elements of the environment represents a resource, which can be consumed to convert heat into an ordered (unitary-like) energy term in the system, even though no work is performed in the global dynamics. Our results therefore represent an instance where thermodynamics can be extended beyond thermal systems, opening the way for combining classical and quantum resources.},

Heat-Bath Algorithmic Cooling is a method to increase the purity of set of qubits coupled to a bath. We investigated the achievable polarization by analyzing the state when no more entropy can be extracted. In particular we give an analytic form for the maximum polarization of the purified qubit and corresponding state of the whole system for the case when the initial state of the qubits is totally mixed. It is however possible to reach higher polarization while starting with other states with higher polarization, thus our result provides an achievable lower bound.

  abstract = {Controlled preparation of highly pure quantum states is at the core of practical applications of quantum information science, from the state initialization of most quantum algorithms to a reliable supply of ancilla qubits that satisfy the fault-tolerance threshold for quantum error correction. Heat-bath algorithmic cooling has been shown to purify qubits by controlled redistribution of entropy and multiple contact with a bath, not only for ensemble implementations but also for technologies with strong but imperfect measurements. However, an implicit restriction about the interaction with the bath has been assumed in previous work. In this paper, we show that better purification can be achieved by removing that restriction. More concretely, we include correlations between the system and the bath, and we take advantage of these correlations to pump entropy out of the system into the bath. We introduce a tool for cooling algorithms, which we call "state-reset", obtained when the coupling to the environment is generalized from individual-qubits relaxation to correlated-qubit relaxation. We present improved cooling algorithms which lead to an increase of purity beyond all the previous work, and relate our results to the Nuclear Overhauser Effect.},

  abstract = {Understanding the origin of irreversibility in thermodynamics has been a fundamental scientific challenge and puzzle for nearly a century. Initially, the discussions related to classical thermodynamic systems, but recently quantum systems became the main focus. Explanations have often been sought by reference to classical equations of motion, which are time-reversible. We conjecture that the origin of irreversibility lies in energy dissipation, a term that is at the core of the Second Law of thermodynamics. However, thermodynamic irreversibility is distinct from time-irreversibility. A system in thermodynamic equilibrium may have reached this state via a deterministic, integrable and therefore time-reversible process, or, alternatively, via an irreversible route, both resulting in thermodynamically indistinguishable states. The process with time-reversible history may become irreversible by a process called thermalization, which occurs when the system loses memory of its history without the necessity of energy dissipation. Quantum systems do this by losing phase coherence; for classical systems the decoherence is at zero frequency, due to loss of time correlation. More generally, not only equilibrium systems may have lost memory of their history. A common cause of memory loss is probabilistic/stochastic events, which are not deterministic and take place only with a certain probability at any given time. In contrast to thermalization, equilibration involves energy dissipation within a system or to the surroundings or by decrease of concentration of the system. Time-reversibility is not related to system size, and the fluctuation theorem is a probabilistic and not a deterministic phenomenon and therefore not suited to provide an understanding of the irreversibility of time in thermodynamic systems. There are also processes which are both dissipative and probabilistic, such as the radiative or non-radiative decay of electronically excited states. Dissipation of a given energy into multiple smaller energy quanta (heat) is by itself not fully reversible for kinetic reasons. It is kinetically a first-order probabilistic process, whereas the reverse is a second- or higher-order process. Thermodynamics provides empirical laws, developed for conventional matter as we know it on planet Earth and in our laboratories. Of relevance here is the Second Law, also called the arrow of time, stating that spontaneous processes take place for isolated systems with increasing entropy. It is assumed to hold also for the universe as a whole. However, over the distances of individual galaxies, self-gravitation leads to conditions where the kinetic energy of the system decreases while the total energy increases, pretending negative heat capacity, and it allows the formation of black holes. This requires an extension of the Second Law. This review aims at presenting an overarching tutorial clarification of the subject.},

Magnetic imaging with nanometric resolution and field detection capabilities in the nanotesla range are enabled by the atomic-size and exceptionally long spin-coherence times of this naturally occurring defect. The exciting perspectives that ensue from these characteristics have triggered vivid experimental activities in the emerging field of "NV magnetometry". It is the purpose of this article to review the recent progress in high-sensitivity nanoscale NV magnetometry, generate an overview of the most pertinent results of the last years and highlight perspectives for future developments. We will present the physical principles that allow for magnetic field detection with NV centres and discuss first applications of NV magnetometers that have been demonstrated in the context of nano magnetism, mesoscopic physics and the life sciences.},

  abstract = {Feedback control in open quantum dynamics is crucial for the advancement of various coherent platforms. For a proper theoretical description, however, most feedback schemes rely on stochastic trajectories, which require significant statistical sampling and lack analytical insight. Currently, only a handful of deterministic feedback master equations exist in the literature. In this letter we derive a set of deterministic equations for describing feedback schemes based on generic causal signals. Our formulation is phrased in terms of sequentially applied quantum instruments, and is therefore extremely general, recovering various known results in the literature as particular cases. We then specialize this result to the case of quantum jumps and derive a new deterministic equation that allows for feedback based on the channel of the last jump, as well as the time since the last jump occurred. The strength of this formalism is illustrated with a detailed study of population inversion of a qubit using coherent drive and feedback, where our formalism allows all calculations to be performed analytically.},

In this review, we first give a pedagogical introduction to the equilibrium behavior of systems in that context, whose scaling framework is essentially developed by exploiting the quantum-to-classical mapping and the renormalization-group theory of critical phenomena at continuous phase transitions. Then we specialize to protocols entailing the out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, such as instantaneous quenches and slow passages across quantum transitions. These are mostly discussed within dynamic scaling frameworks, obtained by appropriately extending the equilibrium scaling laws. We review phenomena at first-order quantum transitions as well, whose peculiar scaling behaviors are characterized by an extreme sensitivity to the boundary conditions, giving rise to exponentials or power laws for the same bulk system. In the last part, we cover aspects related to the effects of dissipative interactions with an environment, through suitable generalizations of the dynamic scaling at quantum transitions. The presentation is limited to issues related to, and controlled by, the quantum transition developed by closed many-body systems, treating the dissipation as a perturbation of the critical regimes, as for the temperature at the zero-temperature quantum transition. We focus on the physical conditions giving rise to a nontrivial interplay between critical modes and various dissipative mechanisms, generally realized when the involved mechanism excites only the low-energy modes of the quantum transitions.},

A recently introduced disispative evolution, inspired by existing models of open system thermalization, has been shown to be efficiently implementable on a quantum computer. Here, we prove that, at high enough temperatures, this evolution reaches the Gibbs state in time scaling logarithmically with system size. The result holds for Hamiltonians that satisfy the Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice, and includes long-range systems. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the rapid mixing property of high-temperature quantum Gibbs samplers, which is known to give the fastest possible speed for thermalization in the many-body setting. We then employ our result to the problem of estimating partition functions at high temperature, showing an improved performance over previous classical and quantum algorithms.},

  abstract = {In quantum communication networks, wires represent well-defined trajectories along which quantum systems are transmitted. In spite of this, trajectories can be used as a quantum control to govern the order of different noisy communication channels, and such a control has been shown to enable the transmission of information even when quantum communication protocols through well-defined trajectories fail. This result has motivated further investigations on the role of the superposition of trajectories in enhancing communication, which revealed that the use of quantum control of parallel communication channels, or of channels in series with quantum-controlled operations, can also lead to communication advantages. Building upon these findings, here we experimentally and numerically compare different ways in which two trajectories through a pair of noisy channels can be superposed. We observe that, within the framework of quantum interferometry, the use of channels in series with quantum-controlled operations generally yields the largest advantages. Our results contribute to clarify the nature of these advantages in experimental quantum-optical scenarios, and showcase the benefit of an extension of the quantum communication paradigm in which both the information exchanged and the trajectory of the information carriers are quantum.},

We then refer to the 'work performed by a gas', or the 'entropy of the gas', regardless of how they are evaluated. Here, we question this conception in the context of quantum thermodynamics, estimating how the definition of pivotal thermodynamic quantities is affected by experimental instruments of limited precision. We find that the coarse-grained thermodynamic quantities frequently lead to different conclusions from those drawn in fine-grained scenarios. For instance, the irreversibility of a process, or its work payoff, can significantly vary with the instrument precision. We show nonetheless that coarse-grained thermodynamic quantities satisfy the same relations (i.e., the second law inequality, the relation between dissipation and distinguishability of a process from its time-reverse, and the quantum work fluctuation theorems) as their fine-grained counterparts. These results highlight the observation-independence of relations linking thermodynamic quantities which are themselves observation-dependent.},

  abstract = {Work is a process-based quantity, and its measurement typically requires interaction with a measuring device multiple times. While classical systems allow for non-invasive and accurate measurements, quantum systems present unique challenges due to the influence of the measuring device on the final value of work. As recent studies have shown, among these challenges is the impossibility of formulating a universal definition of work that respects energy conservation for coherent quantum systems and is compatible with the Jarzynski equality - a fluctuation relation linking the equilibrium free energy difference to the non-equilibrium work. Here we overcome this challenge by introducing a genuinely quantum, positive correction to the Jarzynski equality stemming from imposing energy conservation. When sufficiently large, this correction forces quantum work to violate the second law more often. Moreover, we construct modified two-point measurement (TPM) schemes for work that ensure energy conservation for coherent quantum states and align with our quantum-corrected fluctuation relation. We further underscore the practicality and effectiveness of these schemes by providing detailed circuit implementations for them.},

  abstract = {Although thermodynamic fluctuation theory originated from statistical mechanics, it may be put on a completely thermodynamic basis, in no essential need of any microscopic foundation. This review views the theory from the macroscopic perspective, emphasizing, in particular, notions of covariance and consistency, expressed naturally using the language of Riemannian geometry. Coupled with these concepts is an extension of the basic structure of thermodynamic fluctuation theory beyond the classical one of a subsystem in contact with an infinite uniform reservoir. Used here is a hierarchy of concentric subsystems, each of which samples only the thermodynamic state of the subsystem immediately larger than it. The result is a covariant thermodynamic fluctuation theory which is plausible beyond the standard second-order entropy expansion. It includes the conservation laws and is mathematically consistent when applied to fluctuations inside subsystems. Tests on known models show improvements. Perhaps most significantly, the covariant theory offers a qualitatively new tool for the study of fluctuation phenomena: the Riemannian thermodynamic curvature. The thermodynamic curvature gives, for any given thermodynamic state, a lower bound for the length scale where the classical thermodynamic fluctuation theory based on a uniform environment could conceivably hold. Straightforward computation near the critical point reveals that the curvature equals the correlation volume, a physically appealing finding. The combination of the interpretation of curvature with a well-known proportionality between the free energy and the inverse of the correlation volume yields a purely thermodynamic theory of the critical point. The scaled equation of state follows from the values of the critical exponents. The thermodynamic Riemannian metric may be put into the broader context of information theory.}

  abstract = {Correcting errors in real time is essential for reliable large-scale quantum computations. Realizing this high-level function requires a system capable of several low-level primitives, including single-qubit and two-qubit operations, midcircuit measurements of subsets of qubits, real-time processing of measurement outcomes, and the ability to condition subsequent gate operations on those measurements. In this work, we use a 10-qubit quantum charge-coupled device trapped-ion quantum computer to encode a single logical qubit using the [[7,1,3]] color code, first proposed by Steane [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 793 (1996)]. The logical qubit is initialized into the eigenstates of three mutually unbiased bases using an encoding circuit, and we measure an average logical state preparation and measurement (SPAM) error of 1.7(2){\texttimes}10-3, compared to the average physical SPAM error 2.4(4){\texttimes}10-3 of our qubits. We then perform multiple syndrome measurements on the encoded qubit, using a real-time decoder to determine any necessary corrections that are done either as software updates to the Pauli frame or as physically applied gates. Moreover, these procedures are done repeatedly while maintaining coherence, demonstrating a dynamically protected logical qubit memory. Additionally, we demonstrate non-Clifford qubit operations by encoding a {\textasciimacron}T{\textbar}+{$\rangle$}L magic state with an error rate below the threshold required for magic state distillation. Finally, we present system-level simulations that allow us to identify key hardware upgrades that may enable the system to reach the pseudothreshold.},

  abstract = {We compare two different implementations of fault-tolerant entangling gates on logical qubits. In one instance, a twelve-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer is used to implement a non-transversal logical CNOT gate between two five qubit codes. The operation is evaluated with varying degrees of fault tolerance, which are provided by including quantum error correction circuit primitives known as flagging and pieceable fault tolerance. In the second instance, a twenty-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer is used to implement a transversal logical CNOT gate on two [[7,1,3]] color codes. The two codes were implemented on different but similar devices, and in both instances, all of the quantum error correction primitives, including the determination of corrections via decoding, are implemented during runtime using a classical compute environment that is tightly integrated with the quantum processor. For different combinations of the primitives, logical state fidelity measurements are made after applying the gate to different input states, providing bounds on the process fidelity. We find the highest fidelity operations with the color code, with the fault-tolerant SPAM operation achieving fidelities of 0.99939(15) and 0.99959(13) when preparing eigenstates of the logical X and Z operators, which is higher than the average physical qubit SPAM fidelities of 0.9968(2) and 0.9970(1) for the physical X and Z bases, respectively. When combined with a logical transversal CNOT gate, we find the color code to perform the sequence--state preparation, CNOT, measure out--with an average fidelity bounded by [0.9957,0.9963]. The logical fidelity bounds are higher than the analogous physical-level fidelity bounds, which we find to be [0.9850,0.9903], reflecting multiple physical noise sources such as SPAM errors for two qubits, several single-qubit gates, a two-qubit gate and some amount of memory error.},

Our classification scheme is based on the action of involutive symmetry transformations of a real Markov generator, extending the Bernard-LeClair scheme to the arena of classical stochastic processes and leading to a set of up to fifteen allowed symmetry classes. We construct families of solutions of arbitrary matrix dimensions for five of these classes with a simple physical interpretation of particles hopping on multipartite graphs. In the remaining classes, such a simple construction is prevented by the positivity of entries of the generator particular to classical stochastic processes, which imposes a further requirement beyond the usual symmetry classification constraints. We partially overcome this difficulty by resorting to a stochastic optimization algorithm, finding specific examples of generators of small matrix dimensions in six further classes, leaving the existence of the final four allowed classes an open problem. Our symmetry-based results unveil new possibilities in the dynamics of classical stochastic processes: Kramers degeneracy of eigenvalue pairs, dihedral symmetry of the spectra of Markov generators, and time reversal properties of stochastic trajectories and correlation functions.},

The universal crossover functions are observables of a continuum quantum field theory. Particular attention is focussed on the high temperature limit of the continuum field theory, the so-called ``quantum-critical'' region. Basic features of crossovers are illustrated by a simple solvable model of dilute spinless fermions, and a partially solvable model of dilute bosons. The low frequency relaxational behavior of the quantum-critical region is displayed in the solution of the transverse-field Ising model. The insights from these simple models lead to a fairly complete understanding of the system of primary interest: the two-dimensional quantum rotor model, whose phase transition is expected to be in the same universality class as those in antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin models. Recent work on the experimental implications of these results for the cuprate compounds is briefly reviewed.},

Rydberg enabled capabilities include long-range two-qubit gates, collective encoding of multi-qubit registers, implementation of robust light-atom quantum interfaces, and the potential for simulating quantum many body physics.

The framework involves a system sequentially interacting with a bath comprised of identically prepared units. In this regard, quantum homogenization is a process where the system state approaches the identically prepared state of bath unit in the asymptotic limit. Here, we study the homogenization process for a single qubit in the non-Markovian collisional model framework generated via additional bath-bath interaction. With partial swap operation as both system-bath and bath-bath unitary, we numerically demonstrate that homogenization is achieved irrespective of the initial states of the system or bath units. This is reminiscent of the Markovian scenario, where partial swap is the unique operation for a universal quantum homogenizer. On the other hand, we observe that the rate of homogenization is slower than its Markovian counter part. Interestingly, a different choice of bath-bath unitary speeds up the homogenization process but loses the universality, being dependent on the initial states of the bath units.},

  abstract = {In many scenarios of interest, a quantum system interacts with an unknown environment, necessitating the use of open quantum system methods to capture dissipative effects and environmental noise. With the long-term goal of developing a perturbative theory for open quantum gravity, we take an important step by studying Abelian gauge theories within the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We begin with a pedagogical review of general results for open free theories, setting the stage for our primary focus: constructing the most general open effective field theory for electromagnetism in a medium. We assume locality in time and space, but allow for an arbitrary finite number of derivatives. Crucially, we demonstrate that the two copies of the gauge group associated with the two branches of the Schwinger-Keldysh contour are not broken but are instead deformed by dissipative effects. We provide a thorough discussion of gauge fixing, define covariant gauges, and calculate the photon propagators, proving that they yield gauge-invariant results. A notable result is the discovery that gauge invariance is accompanied by non-trivial constraints on noise fluctuations. We derive these constraints through three independent methods, highlighting their fundamental significance for the consistent formulation of open quantum gauge theories.},

  abstract = {Understanding the precise interaction mechanisms between quantum systems and their environment is crucial for advancing stable quantum technologies, designing reliable experimental frameworks, and building accurate models of real-world phenomena. However, simulating open quantum systems, which feature complex non-unitary dynamics, poses significant computational challenges that require innovative methods to overcome. In this work, we introduce the tensor jump method (TJM), a scalable, embarrassingly parallel algorithm for stochastically simulating large-scale open quantum systems, specifically Markovian dynamics captured by Lindbladians. This method is built on three core principles where, in particular, we extend the Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method to matrix product states, use a dynamic time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) to significantly reduce errors during time evolution, and introduce what we call a sampling MPS to drastically reduce the dependence on the simulation's time step size. We demonstrate that this method scales more effectively than previous methods and ensures convergence to the Lindbladian solution independent of system size, which we show both rigorously and numerically. Finally, we provide evidence of its utility by simulating Lindbladian dynamics of XXX Heisenberg models up to a thousand spins using a consumer-grade CPU. This work represents a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale open quantum systems, with the potential to enable discoveries across various domains of quantum physics, particularly those where the environment plays a fundamental role, and to both dequantize and facilitate the development of more stable quantum hardware.},

  abstract = {Open system quantum dynamics can generate a variety of long-range entangled mixed states, yet it has been unclear in what sense they constitute phases of matter. To establish that two mixed states are in the same phase, as defined by their two-way connectivity via local quantum channels, we use the renormalization group (RG) and decoders of quantum error correcting codes. We introduce a real-space RG scheme for mixed states based on local channels which ideally preserve correlations with the complementary system, and we prove this is equivalent to the reversibility of the channel's action. As an application, we demonstrate an exact RG flow of finite temperature toric code in two dimensions to infinite temperature, thus proving it is in the trivial phase. In contrast, for toric code subject to local dephasing, we establish a mixed state toric code phase using local channels obtained by truncating an RG-type decoder and the minimum weight perfect matching decoder. We also discover a precise relation between mixed state phase and decodability, by proving that local noise acting on toric code cannot destroy logical information without bringing the state out of the toric code phase.},

  abstract = {Despite extensive research, the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying the Mpemba effect, a phenomenon where a substance cools faster after initially being heated, remain elusive. Although historically linked with water, the Mpemba effect manifests across diverse systems, sparking heightened interest in Mpemba-like phenomena. Concurrently, the Kovacs effect, a memory phenomenon observed in materials like polymers, involves rapid quenching and subsequent temperature changes, resulting in nonmonotonic relaxation behavior. This paper probes the intricacies of the Mpemba and Kovacs effects within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling, recognized as a simplistic yet effective phenomenological model accommodating memory phenomena. This law allows for a nuanced comprehension of temperature variations, introducing a time delay (\${\textbackslash}tau\$) and incorporating specific protocols for the thermal bath temperature, contingent on a defined waiting time (\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{w\}\}\$). Remarkably, the relevant parameter space is two-dimensional (\${\textbackslash}tau\$ and \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{w\}\}\$), with bath temperatures exerting no influence on the presence or absence of the Mpemba effect or the relative strength of the Kovacs effect. The findings enhance our understanding of these memory phenomena, providing valuable insights applicable to researchers across diverse fields, ranging from physics to materials science.},

They are also relevant in thermodynamic transformations, and their creation is usually associated to some energetic cost. In this work, we study the role of correlations in the thermodynamic process of state formation in the single-shot regime, and find that correlations can also be viewed as a resource. First, we show that the energetic cost of creating multiple copies of a given state can be reduced by allowing correlations in the final state. We obtain the minimum cost for every finite number of subsystems, and then we show that this feature is not restricted to the case of copies. More generally, we demonstrate that in the asymptotic limit, by allowing a logarithmic amount of correlations, we can recover standard results where the free energy quantifies this minimum cost.},

  abstract = {Information processing at the molecular scale is limited by thermal fluctuations. This can cause undesired consequences in copying information since thermal noise can lead to errors that can compromise the functionality of the copy. For example, a high error rate during DNA duplication can lead to cell death. Given the importance of accurate copying at the molecular scale, it is fundamental to understand its thermodynamic features. In this paper, we derive a universal expression for the copy error as a function of entropy production and \{{\textbackslash}cred work dissipated by the system during wrong incorporations\}. Its derivation is based on the second law of thermodynamics, hence its validity is independent of the details of the molecular machinery, be it any polymerase or artificial copying device. Using this expression, we find that information can be copied in three different regimes. In two of them, work is dissipated to either increase or decrease the error. In the third regime, the protocol extracts work while correcting errors, reminiscent of a Maxwell demon. As a case study, we apply our framework to study a copy protocol assisted by kinetic proofreading, and show that it can operate in any of these three regimes. We finally show that, for any effective proofreading scheme, error reduction is limited by the chemical driving of the proofreading reaction.},

Motivated by this principle, we propose that thermodynamic currents associated with work, heat, and internal energy are described by well-defined Hermitian operators; i.e., we associate physical observables to quantum thermodynamic flows. First, we show that, in principle, it is possible to perform single-point measurements to compute average thermodynamic rates. These rates, or currents, differ from their classical counterparts due to the non-commutativity of the corresponding operators. Using the Robertson-Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger uncertainty relation, we then obtain various thermodynamic uncertainty relationships between them. In particular, we connect the fluctuations in heat rate and thermodynamic power with those in internal energy. We further illustrate this approach by applying it to quantum batteries, where we derive an energy-power uncertainty relationship and show how measurements affect the fluctuations.},

This equation implements the idea of the Wilsonian renormalization group by integrating out quantum fluctuations shell-by-shell in momentum space and gives access to the theory's renormalization group flow beyond the realm of perturbation theory. This chapter gives a pedagogical introduction to the gravitational asymptotic safety program with a specific focus on clarifying conceptual points which led to confusion in the past. We provide a step-by-step introduction to the Wetterich equation and its most commonly used non-perturbative approximations. This exposition also introduces recent developments including the minimal essential scheme and \$N\$-type cutoffs. The use of the Wetterich equation in explicit computations is illustrated within the Einstein-Hilbert truncation which constitutes the simplest non-perturbative approximation of the gravitational renormalization group flow. We conclude with a brief summary and comments on recent developments originating from other quantum gravity programs.},

  abstract = {The quantum Rabi model is a widespread description for the coupling between a two-level system and a quantized single mode of an electromagnetic resonator. Issues about this model's gauge invariance have been raised. These issues become evident when the light-matter interaction reaches the so-called ultrastrong coupling regime. Recently, a modified quantum Rabi model able to provide gauge-invariant physical results in any interaction regime was introduced [Nature Physics 15, 803 (2019)]. Here we provide an alternative derivation of this result, based on the implementation in two-state systems of the gauge principle, which is the principle from which all the fundamental interactions in quantum field theory are derived. The adopted procedure can be regarded as the two-site version of the general method used to implement the gauge principle in lattice gauge theories. Applying this method, we also obtain the gauge-invariant quantum Rabi model for asymmetric two-state systems, and the multi-mode gauge-invariant quantum Rabi model beyond the dipole approximation.},

Most of the article discusses systems in arbitrary dimensions with discrete or continuous Abelian symmetry. Globally and locally symmetric interactions are treated on an equal footing. For convenience, most of the theories are formulated on a d-dimensional (Euclidean) lattice, although duality transformations in the continuum are briefly described. Among the familiar theories considered are the Ising model, the x-y model, the vector Potts model, and the Wilson lattice gauge theory with a ZN or U(1) symmetry, all in various dimensions. These theories are all members of a more general heirarchy of theories with interactions which are distinguished by their geometrical character. For all these Abelian theories it is shown that the duality transformation maps the high-temperature (or, for a field theory, large coupling constant) region of the theory into the low-temperature (small coupling constant) region of the dual theory, and vice versa. The interpretation of the dual variables as disorder parameters is discussed. The formulation of the theories in terms of their topological excitations is presented, and the role of these excitations in determining the phase structure of the theories is explained. Among the other topics discussed are duality for the Abelian Higgs model and related models, duality transformations applied to random systems (such as theories of a spin glass), duality transformations in the "lattice Hamiltonian" formalism, and a description of attempts to construct duality transformations for theories with a non-Abelian symmetry, both on the lattice and in the continuum.}

This includes generic many-body systems, with Hamiltonians with vanishingly small energy spacings that forbid that approximation. The equation satisfies a general form of detailed balance, called KMS, which ensures exact convergence to the many-body Gibbs state. Unlike the more common notion of GNS detailed balance, this notion is compatible with the absence of the rotating wave approximation. We show that the resulting Lindbladian dynamics not only reproduces the thermal equilibrium point, but also approximates the true system evolution with an error that grows at most linearly in time, giving an exponential improvement upon previous estimates. This master equation has quasi-local jump operators, can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, and reduces to the usual Davies dynamics in the limit. With it, we provide a rigorous model of many-body thermalization relevant to both open quantum systems and quantum algorithms.},

Moreover, we complement the review with new results about the relation between Fisher information and physical evolutions. Extending previous works, we show that dynamical properties such as (complete) positivity, Markovianity, detailed balance, retrodictive power of evolution maps can be characterised in terms of their relation with respect to the Fisher information metrics.

  abstract = {A quantum thermodynamic system can conserve non-commuting observables, but the consequences of this phenomenon on relaxation are still not fully understood. We investigate this problem by leveraging an observable-dependent approach to equilibration and thermalization in isolated quantum systems. We extend such approach to scenarios with non-commuting charges, and show that it can accurately estimate the equilibrium distribution of coarse observables without access to the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Our predictions do not require weak coupling and are not restricted to local observables, thus providing an advantage over the non-Abelian thermal state. Within this approach, weak values and quasiprobability distributions emerge naturally and play a crucial role in characterizing the equilibrium distributions of observables. We show and numerically confirm that, due to charges' non-commutativity, these weak values can be anomalous even at equilibrium, which has been proven to be a proxy for non-classicality. Our work thus uncovers a novel connection between the relaxation of observables under non-commuting charges, weak values, and Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distributions.},

  abstract = {The condensed-history electron transport algorithms in the Monte Carlo code MCNP4C are derived from ITS 3.0, which is a well-validated code for coupled electron-photon simulations. This, combined with its user-friendliness and versatility, makes MCNP4C a promising code for medical physics applications. Such applications, however, require a high degree of accuracy. In this work, MCNP4C electron depth-dose distributions in water are compared with published ITS 3.0 results. The influences of voxel size, substeps and choice of electron energy indexing algorithm are investigated at incident energies between 100 keV and 20 MeV. Furthermore, previously published dose measurements for seven beta emitters are simulated. Since MCNP4C does not allow tally segmentation with the *F8 energy deposition tally, even a homogeneous phantom must be subdivided in cells to calculate the distribution of dose. The repeated interruption of the electron tracks at the cell boundaries significantly affects the electron transport. An electron track length estimator of absorbed dose is described which allows tally segmentation. In combination with the ITS electron energy indexing algorithm, this estimator appears to reproduce ITS 3.0 and experimental results well. If, however, cell boundaries are used instead of segments, or if the MCNP indexing algorithm is applied, the agreement is considerably worse.}

  abstract = {Systems of strongly interacting atoms and photons, that can be realized wiring up individual cavity QED systems into lattices, are perceived as a new platform for quantum simulation. While sharing important properties with other systems of interacting quantum particles here we argue that the nature of light-matter interaction gives rise to unique features with no analogs in condensed matter or atomic physics setups. By discussing the physics of a lattice model of delocalized photons coupled locally with two-level systems through the elementary light-matter interaction described by the Rabi model, we argue that the inclusion of counter rotating terms, so far neglected, is crucial to stabilize finite-density quantum phases of correlated photons out of the vacuum, with no need for an artificially engineered chemical potential. We show that the competition between photon delocalization and Rabi non-linearity drives the system across a novel \$Z\_2\$ parity symmetry-breaking quantum criticality between two gapped phases which shares similarities with the Dicke transition of quantum optics and the Ising critical point of quantum magnetism. We discuss the phase diagram as well as the low-energy excitation spectrum and present analytic estimates for critical quantities.},

Although entanglement is routinely observed in many systems, we report here the detection of stronger correlations - Bell correlations - between the spins of about 480 atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. We derive a Bell correlation witness from a many-particle Bell inequality involving only one- and two-body correlation functions. Our measurement on a spin-squeezed state exceeds the threshold for Bell correlations by 3.8 standard deviations. Our work shows that the strongest possible non-classical correlations are experimentally accessible in many-body systems, and that they can be revealed by collective measurements.}

  abstract = {Quantum computing is an emerging technology with potentially far-reaching implications for national prosperity and security. Understanding the timeframes over which economic benefits and national security risks may manifest themselves is vital for ensuring the prudent development of this technology. To inform security experts and policy decision makers on this matter, we review what is currently known on the potential uses and risks of quantum computers, leveraging current research literature. The maturity of currently-available quantum computers is not yet at a level such that they can be used in production for large-scale, industrially-relevant problems, and they are not believed to currently pose security risks. We identify 2 large-scale trends -- new approximate methods (variational algorithms, error mitigation, and circuit knitting) and the commercial exploration of business-relevant quantum applications -- which, together, may enable useful and practical quantum computing in the near future. Crucially, these methods do not appear likely to change the required resources for cryptanalysis on currently-used cryptosystems. From an analysis we perform of the current and known algorithms for cryptanalysis, we find they require circuits of a size exceeding those that can be run by current and near-future quantum computers (and which will require error correction), though we acknowledge improvements in quantum algorithms for these problems are taking place in the literature. In addition, the risk to cybersecurity can be well-managed by the migration to new, quantum-safe cryptographic protocols, which we survey and discuss. Given the above, we conclude there is a credible expectation that quantum computers will be capable of performing computations which are economically-impactful before they will be capable of performing ones which are cryptographically-relevant.},

  abstract = {The situation of two independent observers conducting measurements on a joint quantum system is usually modelled using a Hilbert space of tensor product form, each factor associated to one observer. Correspondingly, the operators describing the observables are then acting non-trivially only on one of the tensor factors. However, the same situation can also be modelled by just using one joint Hilbert space, and requiring that all operators associated to different observers commute, i.e. are jointly measurable without causing disturbance. The problem of Tsirelson is now to decide the question whether all quantum correlation functions between two independent observers derived from commuting observables can also be expressed using observables defined on a Hilbert space of tensor product form. Tsirelson showed already that the distinction is irrelevant in the case that the ambient Hilbert space is of finite dimension. We show here that the problem is equivalent to the question whether all quantum correlation functions can be approximated by correlation function derived from finite-dimensional systems. We also discuss some physical examples which fulfill this requirement.},

Its development was initiated by Bern and Kosower, originally with the aim of simplifying the calculation of scattering amplitudes in quantum chromodynamics and quantum gravity. We give a short account of the original derivation of the Bern-Kosower rules from string theory. Strassler's alternative approach in terms of first-quantized particle path integrals is then used to generalize the formalism to more general field theories, and, in the abelian case, also to higher loop orders. A considerable number of sample calculations are presented in detail, with an emphasis on quantum electrodynamics.},

Using our model, we perform a detailed investigation of the detector's key performance characteristics: namely, detection efficiency, gain, jitter, dead time, and dark counts. We find that entropy production constrains both the efficiency and temporal precision of the detection process, in the sense that improved performance generally requires more dissipation. We also find that reducing either the detection jitter or dead time unavoidably increases the rate of dark counts. Our work establishes a quantitative connection between entropy production and the quality of the irreversible detection process, highlights fundamental tradeoffs in the performance of particle detectors, and provides a framework for further investigations of the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum measurement and amplification.},

In this paradigm, we investigate how objective measurement outcomes can emerge within an purely unitary framework, and find that: (i) the interactions used in standard measurement models fail to spontaneously feature emergent objectivity and (ii) while ideal projective measurements are impossible, we can (for a given form of Hamiltonian) approximate them exponentially well as we collect more physical systems together into an ``observer'' system. We thus lay the groundwork for self-contained models of quantum measurement, proposing improvements to our simple scheme.},

The discussion of superstring theory starts with its perturbation expansion, which exhibits new features including "stringy geometry." The authors then turn to more recent nonperturbative developments. Using new dualities, all known superstring theories are unified, and their strong-coupling behavior is clarified. A central ingredient is the existence of extended objects called branes.}

We evaluate the extractable work in terms of ergotropy, the kinetic energy associated to net directed rotation, as well as the intrinsic work based on the exerted torque under autonomous operation, and we compare them to the energy output for the case of an external dissipative load and for externally driven engine cycles. Our results connect work definitions from both physical and information-theoretical perspectives. In particular, we find that apart from signatures of angular momentum quantization, the ergotropy is consistent with the intuitive notion of work in the form of net directed motion. It also agrees with the energy output to an external load or agent under optimal conditions.

Using tools from parameter estimation theory, we show through a minimal qubit model that individual ancillas can already outperform the thermal Cramer-Rao bound. In addition, due to the steady-state nature of our model, when measured collectively the ancillas always exhibit superlinear scalings of the Fisher information. This means that even collective measurements on pairs of ancillas will already lead to an advantage. As we find in our qubit model, such a feature may be particularly valuable for weak system-ancilla interactions. Our approach sets forth the notion of metrology in a sequential interactions setting, and may inspire further advances in quantum thermometry.},

  abstract = {Motivated by recent discussions of fractons, we explore nonrelativistic field theories with a continuous global symmetry, whose charge is a spatial vector. We present several such symmetries and demonstrate them in concrete examples. They differ by the equations their Noether currents satisfy. Simple cases, other than the translation symmetry, are an ordinary (relativistic) one-form global symmetry and its nonrelativistic generalization. In the latter case the conserved charge is associated with a codimension-one spatial manifold, but it is not topological. More general examples involve charges that are integrated over the entire space. We also discuss the coupling of these systems to gauge fields for these symmetries. We relate our examples to known continuum and lattice constructions.},

  abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics like work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power, can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones like molecular motors, and heat engines like thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

  abstract = {In these lecture notes, the basic principles of stochastic thermodynamics are developed starting with a closed system in contact with a heat bath. A trajectory undergoes Markovian transitions between observable meso-states that correspond to a coarse-grained description of, e.g., a biomolecule or a biochemical network. By separating the closed system into a core system and into reservoirs for ligands and reactants that bind to, and react with the core system, a description as an open system controlled by chemical potentials and possibly an external force is achieved. Entropy production and further thermodynamic quantities defined along a trajectory obey various fluctuation theorems. For describing fluctuations in a non-equilibrium steady state in the long-time limit, the concept of a rate function for large deviations from the mean behaviour is derived from the weight of a trajectory. Universal bounds on this rate function follow which prove and generalize the thermodynamic uncertainty relation that quantifies the inevitable trade-off between cost and precision of any biomolecular process. Specific illustrations are given for molecular motors, Brownian clocks and enzymatic networks that show how these tools can be used for thermodynamic inference of hidden properties of a system.},

  abstract = {For a large class of nonequilibrium systems, thermodynamic notions like work, heat, and, in particular, entropy production can be identified on the level of fluctuating dynamical trajectories. Within stochastic thermodynamics various fluctuation theorems relating these quantities have been proven. Their application to experimental systems requires that all relevant mesostates are accessible. Recent advances address the typical situation that only partial, or coarse-grained, information about a system is available. Thermodynamic inference as a general strategy uses consistency constraints derived from stochastic thermodynamics to infer otherwise hidden properties of nonequilibrium systems. An important class in this respect are active particles, for which we resolve the conflicting strategies that have been proposed to identify entropy production. As a paradigm for thermodynamic inference, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation provides a lower bound on the entropy production through measurements of the dispersion of any current in the system. Likewise, it quantifies the cost of precision for biomolecular processes. Generalizations and ramifications allow the inference of, inter alia, model-free upper bounds on the efficiency of molecular motors and of the minimal number of intermediate states in enzymatic networks.},

The input to the program is simply an arbitrary set of quantum states and an arbitrary set of quantum effects; the program then determines if the Born rule statistics generated by all pairs of these can be explained by a classical (noncontextual) model. If a classical model exists, it provides an explicit model. If it does not, then it computes the minimal amount of noise that must be added such that a model does exist, and then provides this model.

In this paper, we investigate the topic of democratization in the context of QT, particularly quantum computing. The paper contains three main sections. First, we briefly introduce different theories of democracy (participatory, representative, and deliberative) and how the concept of democratization can be formulated with respect to whether democracy is taken as an intrinsic or instrumental value. Second, we give an overview of how the concept of democratization is used in the QT field. Democratization is mainly adopted by companies working on quantum computing and used in a very narrow understanding of the concept. Third, we explore various narratives and counter-narratives concerning democratization in QT. Finally, we explore the general efforts of democratization in QT such as different forms of access, formation of grassroot communities and special interest groups, the emerging culture of manifesto writing, and how these can be located within the different theories of democracy. In conclusion, we argue that although the ongoing efforts in the democratization of QT are necessary steps towards the democratization of this set of emerging technologies, they should not be accepted as sufficient to argue that QT is a democratized field. We argue that more reflexivity and responsiveness regarding the narratives and actions adopted by the actors in the QT field, and making the underlying assumptions of ongoing efforts on democratization of QT explicit, can result in a better technology for society.},

  abstract = {The interaction between the electromagnetic field inside a cavity and natural or artificial atoms has played a crucial role in developing our understanding of light-matter interaction, and is central to various quantum technologies. Recently, new regimes beyond the weak and strong light-matter coupling have been explored in several settings. These regimes, where the interaction strength is comparable (ultrastrong) or even higher (deep-strong) than the transition frequencies in the system, can give rise to new physical effects and applications. At the same time, they challenge our understanding of cavity QED. When the interaction strength is so high, fundamental issues like the proper definition of subsystems and of their quantum measurements, the structure of light-matter ground states, or the analysis of time-dependent interactions are subject to ambiguities leading to even qualitatively distinct predictions. The resolution of these ambiguities is also important for understanding and designing next-generation quantum devices that will exploit the ultrastrong coupling regime. Here we discuss and provide solutions to these issues.},

It is shown how renormalization ideas can be applied to explain universality and compute Feigenbaum's constants. Then, universality is presented in the scenario of quantum field theories, and studied by means of functional renormalization group equations, which allow for a close comparison with the case of dynamical systems. In particular, Wetterich equation for a scalar field is derived and discussed, and then applied to the computation of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point and critical exponent for the Ising universality class.

For this model we study photon fluctuations in the critical region of normal-to-superradiant phase transition when both the temperatures and numbers of two-level systems are finite. In this case, the superradiant quantum phase transition is changed to a fluctuational region in the phase diagram that reveals two types of critical behaviors. These are regimes of Dicke model (with discrete Z 2 symmetry), and that of anti-Tavis-Cummings and Tavis-Cummings U ( 1 ) models. We show that squeezing parameters of photon condensate in these regimes show distinct temperature scalings. Besides, relative fluctuations of a photon number take universal values. We also find a temperature scale below which one approaches a zero-temperature quantum phase transition where quantum fluctuations dominate. Our effective theory is provided by a non-Goldstone functional for condensate mode and by Majorana representation of Pauli operators. We also discuss the Bethe ansatz solution for integrable U ( 1 ) limits.}

  abstract = {These lecture notes were prepared for a 25-hour course for advanced undergraduate students participating in Perimeter Institute's Undergraduate Summer Program. The lectures cover some of what is currently known about the possibility of superluminal travel and time travel within the context of established science, that is, general relativity and quantum field theory. Previous knowledge of general relativity at the level of a standard undergraduate-level introductory course is recommended, but all the relevant material is included for completion and reference. No previous knowledge of quantum field theory, or anything else beyond the standard undergraduate curriculum, is required. Advanced topics in relativity, such as causal structures, the Raychaudhuri equation, and the energy conditions are presented in detail. Once the required background is covered, concepts related to faster-than-light travel and time travel are discussed. After introducing tachyons in special relativity as a warm-up, exotic spacetime geometries in general relativity such as warp drives and wormholes are discussed and analyzed, including their limitations. Time travel paradoxes are also discussed in detail, including some of their proposed resolutions.},

  abstract = {In the current era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, research in the theory of open system dynamics has a crucial role to play. In particular, understanding and quantifying memory effects in quantum systems is critical to gain a better handle on the effects of noise in quantum devices. The main focus of this review is to address the fundamental question of defining and characterizing such memory effects -- broadly referred to as quantum non-Markovianity -- from various approaches. We first discuss the two-time-parameter maps approach to open system dynamics and review the various notions of quantum non-Markovianity that arise in this paradigm. We then discuss an alternate approach to quantum stochastic processes based on the quantum combs framework, which accounts for multi-time correlations. We discuss the interconnections and differences between these two paradigms, and conclude with a discussion on necessary and sufficient conditions for quantum non-Markovianity.},

We give an overview of results in areas of current research interest, such as Bayesian quantum estimation, noisy quantum metrology, and distributed quantum sensing. We address the question how minimum measurement errors can be achieved using entanglement as well as more general quantum states. This review is presented from a geometric perspective.

We review developments in this emerging area of space-based quantum technologies and provide a roadmap of key milestones towards a complete, global quantum networked landscape.

They share in common that coherent and driven-dissipative quantum dynamics occur on an equal footing, creating genuine non-equilibrium scenarios without immediate counterpart in condensed matter. This concerns both their non-thermal flux equilibrium states, as well as their many-body time evolution. It is a challenge to theory to identify novel instances of universal emergent macroscopic phenomena, which are tied unambiguously and in an observable way to the microscopic drive conditions. In this review, we discuss some recent results in this direction. Moreover, we provide a systematic introduction to the open system Keldysh functional integral approach, which is the proper technical tool to accomplish a merger of quantum optics and many-body physics, and leverages the power of modern quantum field theory to driven open quantum systems.},

  abstract = {Universality is a powerful concept that enables qualitative and quantitative predictions to be made in systems with extensively many degrees of freedom. It finds realizations in almost all branches of physics, including in the realm of nonequilibrium systems. The focus of this review is on universality's manifestations within a specific class of nonequilibrium stationary states: driven open quantum matter. Progress in this field is fueled by a number of increasingly prominent platforms ranging from light-driven quantum materials over synthetic quantum systems like cold atomic gases to the functional devices of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. These systems share the characteristic that, on the microscopic scale, they obey the laws of quantum mechanics, while detailed balance underlying thermodynamic equilibrium is broken owing to the simultaneous presence of Hamiltonian unitary dynamics and nonunitary drive and dissipation. The challenge is then to connect this microscopic physics to macroscopic observables and to identify universal collective phenomena that uniquely witness the breaking of equilibrium conditions, thus having no equilibrium counterparts. In the framework of a Lindblad-Keldysh field theory, on the one hand, this review discusses the principles delimiting thermodynamic equilibrium from driven open stationary states, and, on the other hand, it is shown how unifying concepts such as symmetries, the purity of states, and scaling arguments are implemented. Then presented are instances of universal behavior structured into three classes: new realizations of paradigmatic nonequilibrium phenomena, including a survey of first experimental realizations; novel instances of nonequilibrium universality found in these systems made of quantum ingredients; and genuinely quantum phenomena out of equilibrium, including in fermionic systems. Perspectives for future research on driven open quantum matter are also discussed.},

The past decade has seen important results related to both the limits of state transformation and the limits to their efficiency -- the quantum versions of the third and second law of thermodynamics. The limiting cases always involve an infinite resource cost, typically machine complexity or time. Realistic state preparation takes into account both a finite size of the machine and constraints on the operations we can perform. In this work, we determine in full generality the optimal operation for a predominant quantum paradigm: state transformation under a single unitary operation upon a finite system, in the case where the observables corresponding to the target (such as ground state probability) and cost (such as dissipation) commute. We then extend this result to the case of having a third, commuting, globally conserved quantity (such as total energy). The results are demonstrated with the paradigmatic example of ground state cooling, for both arbitrary and energy-preserving unitary operations.},

We find that suitable protocols for this type of quantum channel require the careful navigation of several constraints, such as the no-cloning principle, the strong Huygens principle and the tendency of short field-matter couplings to be entanglement breaking. We non-perturbatively construct a protocol for such a quantum channel that possesses maximal quantum capacity.}

In particular, we examine correlations beyond the standard bipartite entanglement and derive exact results in the thermodynamic limit. The model presents two superradiant phases involving the spontaneous breaking of either a \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ or \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{U\}(1)\$ symmetry. The latter is characterized by the emergence of a Goldstone excitation, found to significantly affect the correlation profiles. Focusing on the correlations between macroscopic subsystems, we analyze both the mutual information as well as the entanglement of formation for all possible bipartitions among the optical and matter degrees of freedom. It is found that while each mode entangles with the atoms, the bipartite entanglement between the modes is zero, and they share only classical correlations and quantum discord. We also study the monogamy of multipartite entanglement and show that there exists genuine tripartite entanglement, i.e. quantum correlations that the atoms share with the two modes but that are not shared with them individually, only in the vicinity of the critical lines. Our results elucidate the intricate correlation structures underlying superradiant phase transitions in multimode systems.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the idea that quantum computers can be useful in advancing basic science, we use a quantum processor to experimentally validate a number of theoretical results in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics, that were not (or were very little) corroborated so far. In order to do so, we first put forward a novel method to implement the so called two-point measurement scheme, which is at the basis of the study of nonequilibrium energetic exchanges in quantum systems. Like previously established methods, our method uses an ancillary system, but at variance with them, it provides direct access to the energy exchange statistics, and is, accordingly more effective, at least when applied to small quantum systems. Using a quantum computer as a remotely programmable experimental platform, we first validate our ancilla-assisted two-point measurement scheme, and then apply it to (i) experimentally verify that fluctuation theorems are robust against projective measurements, a theoretical prediction, which was not validated so far; (ii) experimentally verify the so-called heat-engine fluctuation relation, by implementing a swap quantum heat engine; (iii) experimentally verify that the heat-engine fluctuation relation holds for measurement-fueled quantum heat engines, by implementing the design at the basis of the so-called quantum-measurement-cooling concept. For both engines, we report the measured average heat and work exchanged and single out their operation mode. Our experiments constitute an experimental basis for the understanding of the nonequilibrium energetics of quantum computation and for the implementation of energy-management devices on quantum processors.}

  abstract = {The entanglement entropy is a fundamental quantity, which characterizes the correlations between sub-systems in a larger quantum-mechanical system. For two sub-systems separated by a surface the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area of the surface and depends on the UV cutoff, which regulates the short-distance correlations. The geometrical nature of entanglement-entropy calculation is particularly intriguing when applied to black holes when the entangling surface is the black-hole horizon. I review a variety of aspects of this calculation: the useful mathematical tools such as the geometry of spaces with conical singularities and the heat kernel method, the UV divergences in the entropy and their renormalization, the logarithmic terms in the entanglement entropy in four and six dimensions and their relation to the conformal anomalies. The focus in the review is on the systematic use of the conical singularity method. The relations to other known approaches such as 't Hooft's brick-wall model and the Euclidean path integral in the optical metric are discussed in detail. The puzzling behavior of the entanglement entropy due to fields, which non-minimally couple to gravity, is emphasized. The holographic description of the entanglement entropy of the blackhole horizon is illustrated on the two- and four-dimensional examples. Finally, I examine the possibility to interpret the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy entirely as the entanglement entropy.},

However, the standard proofs of the fundamental theorems of modular flow use machinery from Fourier analysis on Banach spaces, and as such are not especially transparent to an audience of physicists. In this article, I present a construction of modular flow that differs from existing treatments. The main pedagogical contribution is that I start with thermal physics via the KMS condition, and derive the modular operator as the only operator that could generate a thermal time-evolution map, rather than starting with the modular operator as the fundamental object of the theory. The main technical contribution is a new proof of the fundamental theorem stating that modular flow is a symmetry. The new proof circumvents the delicate issues of Fourier analysis that appear in previous treatments, but is still mathematically rigorous.},

  abstract = {Starting from a microscopic system-baths description, we derive the general conditions for a time-local quantum master equation (QME) to satisfy the first and second law of thermodynamics at the fluctuating level. Using counting statistics, we show that the fluctuating second law can be rephrased as a Generalized Quantum Detailed Balance condition (GQDB), i.e., a symmetry of the time-local generators which ensures the validity of the fluctuation theorem. When requiring in addition a strict system-bath energy conservation, the GQDB reduces to the usual notion of detailed balance which ensures QMEs with Gibbsian steady states. However, if energy conservation is only required on average, QMEs with non Gibbsian steady states can still maintain a certain level of thermodynamic consistency. Applying our theory to commonly used QMEs, we show that the Redfield equation breaks the GQDB, and that some recently derived approximation schemes based on the Redfield equation (which hold beyond the secular approximation and allow to derive a QME of Lindblad form) satisfy the GQDB and the average first law. We find that performing the secular approximation is the only way to ensure the first and second law at the fluctuating level.},

The multicritical point now becomes brittle and splits into two tricritical points where first- and second-order symmetry-breaking transitions meet.

Consequently, we reveal that fluctuations flip from being particle-like to hole-like across this transition. This inversion is also accompanied by the behaviour of the Liouvillian eigenvalues akin to exceptional points.

This may arise from active contributions to particle fluctuations which are unrelated to the dissipative resistance of the surrounding medium. We show that in these cases the widely used relation between informatic entropy production and heat dissipation does not hold. Consequently, fluctuation relations for the mechanical work, such as the Jarzynski and Crooks theorems, are invalid. We relate the breaking of the correspondence between entropy production and heat dissipation to departure from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We propose a temperaturelike variable that restores this correspondence and gives rise to a generalized second law of thermodynamics, whereby the dissipated heat is necessarily non-negative and vanishes at equilibrium. The Clausius inequality, Carnot maximum efficiency theorem, and relation between the extractable work and the change of free energy are recovered as well.},

Since the representation of a fixed photonic quantum state in different optical mode bases can substantially influence the entanglement properties of said state, we devise a constructive method to obtain families of states with the genuine feature of remaining entangled for any choice of mode decomposition. In the first step, we focus on two-photon states in a bipartite system and optimize their entanglement properties with respect to unitary mode transformations. Applying a necessary and sufficient entanglement witness criteria, we are then able to prove that the class of constructed states is entangled for arbitrary mode decompositions. Furthermore, we provide optimal bounds to the robustness of the mode-independent entanglement under general imperfections. In the second step, we demonstrate the power of our technique by showing how it can be straightforwardly extended to higher-order photon numbers in multipartite systems, together with providing a generally applicable and rigorous definition of mode-independent separability and inseparability for mixed states.},

  abstract = {We study a one-dimensional lattice system of free fermions subjected to a generalized measurement process: the system exchanges particles with its environment, but each fermion leaving or entering the system is counted. In contrast to the freezing of dynamics due to frequent measurements of lattice site occupation numbers, a high rate of fermion counts induces fast fluctuations in the state of the system. Still, through numerical simulations of quantum trajectories and an analytical approach based on replica Keldysh field theory, we find that instantaneous correlations and entanglement properties of free fermions subjected to fermion counting and local occupation measurements are strikingly similar. We explain this similarity through a generalized Zeno effect induced by fermion counting and a universal long-wavelength description in terms of a nonlinear sigma model. The physical requirements underlying this universal emergent behavior are conservation of the total number of particles in the system and its environment, and conservation of the purity of the state of the system by keeping a full record of all measurement outcomes. For both types of measurement processes, we present strong evidence against the existence of a critical phase with logarithmic entanglement and conformal invariance. Instead, we identify a finite critical range of length scales on which signatures of conformal invariance are observable. While area-law entanglement is established beyond a scale that is exponentially large in the measurement rate, the upper boundary of the critical range is only algebraically large and thus numerically accessible. Our finding that these properties do not rely on particle-number conservation has far-reaching implications for measurement-induced phenomena beyond noninteracting fermions, such as charge sharpening in random quantum circuits or generic interacting systems.},

In this pedagogical review, we re-examine the folklore surrounding its three standard approximations (Born, Markov, and Rotating Wave Approximation), as we build our narrative by employing a series of examples and case studies accessible to any reader with a solid background on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. As a synthesis of our work, we offer a checklist that contrasts common lore with refined expectations, offering a practical guideline for assessing the breakdown of the Lindblad framework in the problem at hand.},

  abstract = {In quantum field theory, bare particles are dressed by a cloud of virtual particles to form physical particles. The virtual particles affect properties such as the mass and charge of the physical particles, and it is only these modified properties that can be measured in experiments, not the properties of the bare particles. The influence of virtual particles is prominent in the ultrastrong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has recently been realised in several condensed-matter systems. In some of these systems, the effective interaction between atom-like transitions and the cavity photons can be switched on or off by external control pulses. This offers unprecedented possibilities for exploring quantum vacuum fluctuations and the relation between physical and bare particles. We consider a single three-level quantum system coupled to an optical resonator. Here we show that, by applying external electromagnetic pulses of suitable amplitude and frequency, each virtual photon dressing a physical excitation in cavity-QED systems can be converted into a physical observable photon, and back again. In this way, the hidden relationship between the bare and the physical excitations can be unravelled and becomes experimentally testable. The conversion between virtual and physical photons can be clearly pictured using Feynman diagrams with cut loops.},

We begin by addressing a fundamental issue concerning the \{{\textbackslash}em ab initio\} Hamiltonian in the harmonic approximation, which we show must be determined \{{\textbackslash}em self-consistently\} to avoid inconsistencies. After identifying the most suitable partitioning into a ``noninteracting'' and an ``interacting'' part we embark on the Green's function diagrammatic analysis. We single out key diagrammatic structures to carry on the expansion in terms of dressed propagators and screened interaction. The final outcome is the finite-temperature nonequilibrium extension of the Hedin equations, featuring the appearance of the time-local Ehrenfest diagram in the electronic self-energy. The Hedin equations have limited practical utility for real-time simulations of driven systems. We leverage the versatility of diagrammatic expansion to generate a closed system of integro-differential equations for the Green's functions and nuclear displacements. These are the Kadanoff-Baym equations for electrons and phonons. Another advantage of the diagrammatic derivation is the ability to use conserving approximations, which ensure the satisfaction of all fundamental conservation laws during the time evolution. As an example we show that the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation is not conserving whereas its dynamical extension is conserving provided that the electrons are treated in the Fan-Migdal approximation with a dynamically screened electron-phonon coupling. We also derive the formal solution of the Kadanoff-Baym equations in the long time limit and at the steady state. The expansion of the phononic Green's function around the quasi-phonon energies points to a possible correlation-induced splitting of the phonon dispersion in materials with no time-reversal invariance.},

We report the observation of Hawking radiation emitted by this black-hole analogue, which is the output of the black-hole laser formed between the horizons.

We further prove that every frozen configuration is absolutely stable to arbitrary perturbations, to all finite orders in perturbation theory. In particular, our proof is not limited to symmetric perturbations, or to perturbations with compact support, but also applies to perturbations with long-range tails, and even to arbitrary geometrically nonlocal \$k\$-body perturbations, as long as \$k/L {\textbackslash}rightarrow 0\$ in the thermodynamic limit, where \$L\$ is linear system size. Additionally, we identify one-form \$U(1)\$ charges characterizing some non-frozen sectors, and discuss the dynamics starting from typical initial conditions, which we argue is best interpreted in terms of the magnetohydrodynamics of the emergent one-form symmetry.},

The qualitative final-time predictions obtained from these models, including entanglement and photon number, depend on the gauge within which the time-dependent coupling assumption is made. This occurs whenever the interaction switching is sufficiently strong and non-adiabatic even if the coupling vanishes at the preparation and measurement stages of the protocol, at which times the subsystems are unique and experimentally addressable.},

We show that the approach proposed recently in Nature Physics 15, 803 (2019) rests on an incorrect mathematical assertion and so does not resolve gauge non-invariance. It produces new two-level models that are not equivalent in different gauges. The new Coulomb-gauge model is inaccurate for the regimes considered in Nature Physics 15, 803 (2019), for which the multipolar-gauge quantum Rabi model is accurate. The models analysed in Nature Physics 15, 803 (2019) do not result from the argument provided in the main text, but instead from truncation within the multipolar-gauge followed by the application of a truncated phase-invariance principle. More generally, this principle can be applied following truncation in any gauge and it yields an equivalence class of truncated models within the gauge chosen. Equivalence classes belonging to different gauges are not equivalent and the truncated phase-invariance principle does not provide an argument to prefer a particular class. In general, the optimal class depends on the physical situation, including the observables, the parameter regime, and the number of field modes being considered. We also emphasise that gauge-ambiguities are not synonymous with gauge non-invariance due to approximations. Independent of material truncation subsystem predictions can be vastly different depending on the theoretical definitions of the subsystems, which are controlled by the gauge choice. This constitutes an example of vector-space relativity that in no way contradicts gauge-invariance. However, within ultrastrong-coupling regimes this relativity can no longer be ignored.},

Each definition uses different gauge-invariant observables. This relativity is eliminated only if a sufficient number of Markovian and weak-coupling approximations are employed. All physical predictions are gauge invariant, including subsystem properties such as photon number and entanglement. However, subsystem properties naturally differ for different physical subsystems. Gauge ambiguities arise not because it is unclear how to obtain gauge-invariant predictions, but because it is not always clear which physical observables are the most operationally relevant. The gauge invariance of a prediction is necessary but not sufficient to ensure its operational relevance. It is shown that, in controlling which gauge invariant observables are used to define a material system, the choice of gauge affects the balance between the material system's localization and its electromagnetic dressing. Various implications of subsystem gauge relativity for deriving effective models, for describing time-dependent interactions, for photodetection theory, and for describing matter within a cavity are reviewed.},

We find that the gauge choice controls the extent to which this polarisation is included as part of the radiative quantum subsystem and thereby determines the degree to which the abnormal phase is classed as superradiant. This resolves the long-standing paradox of no-go and counter no-go theorems for superradiance, which are shown to refer to different definitions of radiation.},

These definitions are shown to satisfy the phenomenological laws of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for a large class of states and processes. The consistency with previous results is demonstrated. The framework applies to multiple baths including particle transport and accounts for processes with, e.g., a changing temperature of the bath, which is determined microscopically. An integral fluctuation theorem for entropy production is satisfied.

  abstract = {The theory of thermodynamics has been one of the bedrocks of 19th-century physics, and thermodynamic problems have inspired Planck's quantum hypothesis. One hundred years later, in an era where we design increasingly sophisticated nanotechnologies, researchers in quantum physics have been 'returning to their roots', attempting to reconcile modern nanoscale devices with the theory of thermodynamics. This textbook explains how it is possible to unify the two opposite pictures of microscopic quantum physics and macroscopic thermodynamics in one consistent framework, proving that the ancient theory of thermodynamics still offers many remarkable insights into present-day problems.This textbook focuses on the microscopic derivation and understanding of key principles and concepts and their interrelation. The topics covered in this book include (quantum) stochastic processes, (quantum) master equations, local detailed balance, classical stochastic thermodynamics, (quantum) fluctuation theorems, strong coupling and non-Markovian effects, thermodynamic uncertainty relations, operational approaches, Maxwell's demon, and time-reversal symmetry, among other topics. The textbook also explores several practical applications of the theory in more detail, including single-molecule pulling experiments, quantum transport and thermoelectric effects in quantum dots, the micromaser, and related setups in quantum optics. The aim of this book is to inspire readers to investigate a plethora of modern nanoscale devices from a thermodynamic point of view, allowing them to address their dissipation, efficiency, reliability, and power based on a conceptually clear understanding about the microscopic origin of heat, entropy, and the second law. The book is accessible to graduate students, post-docs, and lecturers, but will also be of interest to all researchers striving for a deeper understanding of the laws of thermodynamics beyond their traditional realm of applicability.                                                        ,                The theory of thermodynamics has been one of the bedrocks of 19th-century physics, and thermodynamic problems have inspired Planck's quantum hypothesis. One hundred years later, in an era where we design increasingly sophisticated nanotechnologies, researchers in quantum physics have been 'returning to their roots', attempting to reconcile modern nanoscale devices with the theory of thermodynamics. This textbook explains how it is possible to unify the two opposite pictures of microscopic quantum physics and macroscopic thermodynamics in one consistent framework, proving that the ancient theory of thermodynamics still offers many remarkable insights into present-day problems.This textbook focuses on the microscopic derivation and understanding of key principles and concepts and their interrelation. The topics covered in this book include (quantum) stochastic processes, (quantum) master equations, local detailed balance, classical stochastic thermodynamics, (quantum) fluctuation theorems, strong coupling and non-Markovian effects, thermodynamic uncertainty relations, operational approaches, Maxwell's demon, and time-reversal symmetry, among other topics. The textbook also explores several practical applications of the theory in more detail, including single-molecule pulling experiments, quantum transport and thermoelectric effects in quantum dots, the micromaser, and related setups in quantum optics.

Quantum coherence in many-body systems embodies the essence of entanglement and is an essential ingredient for a plethora of physical phenomena in quantum optics, quantum information, solid state physics, and nanoscale thermodynamics. In recent years, research on the presence and functional role of quantum coherence in biological systems has also attracted a considerable interest. Despite the fundamental importance of quantum coherence, the development of a rigorous theory of quantum coherence as a physical resource has only been initiated recently. In this Colloquium we discuss and review the development of this rapidly growing research field that encompasses the characterization, quantification, manipulation, dynamical evolution, and operational application of quantum coherence.}

XOR oblivious transfer (XOT) is a variant where the sender Alice has two bits, and a receiver Bob obtains either the first bit, the second bit, or their XOR. Bob should not learn anything more than this, and Alice should not learn what Bob has learnt. Perfect quantum OT with information-theoretic security is known to be impossible. We determine the smallest possible cheating probabilities for unrestricted dishonest parties in non-interactive quantum XOT protocols using symmetric pure states, and present an optimal protocol, which outperforms classical protocols. We also "reverse" this protocol, so that Bob becomes sender of a quantum state and Alice the receiver who measures it, while still implementing oblivious transfer from Alice to Bob. Cheating probabilities for both parties stay the same as for the unreversed protocol. We optically implemented both the unreversed and the reversed protocols, and cheating strategies, noting that the reversed protocol is easier to implement.},

For the case of orthogonal measurement we establish a quantitative connection between incompatibility, quantum coherence and entropic uncertainty relations.

For millennia, the concept of nothingness, in many forms and guises, has occupied reflective minds, who have adopted an extraordinary range of stances toward the notion---from holding that it is the Godhead itself to rejecting it vehemently as a foul blasphemy. Even among more scientifically inclined thinkers, there has been a similar range of views [49]. We have no intention here to sketch this vast richness of thought about nothingness. Instead, we shall more modestly attempt to explain what mathematical physics has to say about nothingness in its modern scientific guise: the relativistic vacuum state. What is the vacuum in modern science? Roughly speaking, it is that which is left over after all that can possibly be removed has been removed, where ``possibly'' refers to neither ``technically possible'' nor to ``logically possible'' but rather to ``physically possible''---that which is possible in light of (the current understanding of) the laws of physics. The vacuum is therefore an idealization that is only approximately realized in the laboratory and in nature. But it is a most useful idealization and a surprisingly rich concept. We discuss the vacuum solely in the context of the relativistic quantum theory of systems in four spacetime dimensional Minkowski space, although we briefly indicate how similar states for quantum systems in other spacetimes can be defined and studied. In a relativistic theory of systems in Minkowski space, the vacuum should appear to be the same at every position and in every direction for all inertial observers.},

  abstract = {According to 't Hooft the combination of quantum mechanics and gravity requires the three dimensional world to be an image of data that can be stored on a two dimensional projection much like a holographic image. The two dimensional description only requires one discrete degree of freedom per Planck area and yet it is rich enough to describe all three dimensional phenomena. After outlining 't Hooft's proposal I give a preliminary informal description of how it may be implemented. One finds a basic requirement that particles must grow in size as their momenta are increased far above the Planck scale. The consequences for high energy particle collisions are described. The phenomena of particle growth with momentum was previously discussed in the context of string theory and was related to information spreading near black hole horizons. The considerations of this paper indicate that the effect is much more rapid at all but the earliest times. In fact the rate of spreading is found to saturate the bound from causality. Finally we consider string theory as a possible realization of 't Hooft's idea. The light front lattice string model of Klebanov and Susskind is reviewed and its similarities with the holographic theory are demonstrated. The agreement between the two requires unproven but plausible assumptions about the nonperturbative behavior of string theory. Very similar ideas to those in this paper have been long held by Charles Thorn.},

  abstract = {Quantum technologies represent a rapidly evolving field in which the specific properties of quantum mechanical systems are exploited to enhance the performance of various applications such as sensing, transmission, and processing of information. Such devices can be useful only if the quantum systems also interact with their environment. However, the interactions with the environment can degrade the specific quantum properties of these systems, such as coherence and entanglement. It is therefore essential that the interaction between a quantum system and the environment is controlled in such a way that the unwanted effects of the environment are suppressed while the necessary interactions are retained. This Colloquium gives an overview, aimed at newcomers to this field, of some of the challenges that need to be overcome to achieve this goal. A number of techniques have been developed for this purpose in different areas of physics including magnetic resonance, optics, and quantum information. They include the application of static or time-dependent fields to the quantum system, which are designed to average the effect of the environmental interactions to zero. Quantum error correction schemes were developed to detect and eliminate certain errors that occur during the storage and processing of quantum information. In many physical systems, it is useful to use specific quantum states that are intrinsically less susceptible to environmental noise for encoding the quantum information. The dominant contribution to the loss of information is pure dephasing, i.e., through the loss of coherence in quantum mechanical superposition states. Accordingly, most schemes for reducing loss of information focus on dephasing processes. This is also the focus of this Colloquium.}

Second, we prove that the geodesic length of ITE determines the query complexity of Grover's algorithm. This complexity notably aligns with the known optimal scaling for unstructured search. Lastly, utilizing the geodesic structure of ITE, we construct a quantum signal processing formulation for ITE without post-selection, and derive a new set of angles for the fixed-point search. These results collectively establish a deeper understanding of Grover's algorithm and suggest a potential role for thermodynamics and geometry in quantum algorithm design.},

  abstract = {The operator algebra of fermionic modes is isomorphic to that of qubits, the difference between them is twofold: the embedding of subalgebras corresponding to mode subsets and multiqubit subsystems on the one hand, and the parity superselection in the fermionic case on the other. We discuss these two fundamental differences extensively, and illustrate these through the Jordan--Wigner representation in a coherent, self-contained, pedagogical way, from the point of view of quantum information theory. Our perspective leads us to develop useful new tools for the treatment of fermionic systems, such as the fermionic (quasi-)tensor product, fermionic canonical embedding, fermionic partial trace, fermionic products of maps and fermionic embeddings of maps. We formulate these by direct, easily applicable formulas, without mode permutations, for arbitrary partitionings of the modes. It is also shown that fermionic reduced states can be calculated by the fermionic partial trace, containing the proper phase factors. We also consider variants of the notions of fermionic mode correlation and entanglement, which can be endowed with the usual, local operation based motivation, if the parity superselection rule is imposed. We also elucidate some other fundamental points, related to joint map extensions, which make the parity superselection inevitable in the description of fermionic systems.},

The script itself is largely self-contained and could be used as a textbook on the topic of open quantum systems. The program of this course is based on a novel approach to the description of the open system dynamics: It is showed how the environmental degrees of freedom coupled to the system can be represented by a multi-component quasi-stochastic process. Using this representation one constructs the super-quasi-cumulant (or super-qumulant) expansion for the system's dynamical map -- a parametrization that naturally lends itself for the development of a robust and practical perturbation theory.

  abstract = {Gibbs-preserving operations have been studied as one of the standard free processes in quantum thermodynamics. Although they admit a simple mathematical structure, their operational significance has been unclear due to the potential hidden cost to implement them using an operatioanlly motivated class of operations, such as thermal operations. Here, we show that this hidden cost can be infinite -- we present a family of Gibbs-preserving operations that cannot be implemented by thermal operations aided by any finite amount of quantum coherence. Our result implies that there are uncountably many Gibbs-preserving operations that require unbounded thermodynamic resources to implement, raising a question about employing Gibbs-preserving operations as available thermodynamics processes. This finding is a consequence of the general lower bounds we provide for the coherence cost of approximately implementing a certain class of Gibbs-preserving operations with a desired accuracy. We find that our lower bound is almost tight, identifying a quantity -- related to the energy change caused by the channel to implement -- as a fundamental quantifier characterizing the coherence cost for the approximate implementation of Gibbs-preserving operations.},

  abstract = {Quantum technologies offer exceptional -- sometimes almost magical -- speed and performance, yet every quantum process costs physical resources. Designing next-generation quantum devices, therefore, depends on solving the following question: which resources, and in what amount, are required to implement a desired quantum process? Casting the problem in the language of quantum resource theories, we prove a universal cost-irreversibility tradeoff: the lower the irreversibility of a quantum process, the greater the required resource cost for its realization. The trade-off law holds for a broad range of resources -- energy, magic, asymmetry, coherence, athermality, and others -- yielding lower bounds on resource cost of any quantum channel. Its broad scope positions this result as a foundation for deriving the following key results: (1) we show a universal relation between the energetic cost and the irreversibility for arbitrary channels, encompassing the energy-error tradeoff for any measurement or unitary gate; (2) we extend the energy-error tradeoff to free energy and work costs; (3) we extend the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem, which is the universal limitation on measurements under conservation laws, to a wide class of resource theories: the probability of failure in distinguishing resourceful states via a measurement is inversely proportional to its resource cost; (4) we prove that infinitely many resource-non-increasing operations in fact require an infinite implementation cost. These findings reveal a universal relationship between quantumness and irreversibility, providing a first step toward a general theory that explains when -- and how -- quantumness can suppress irreversibility.},

  abstract = {Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.},

The algorithms speeding up these problems, amplitude amplification and amplitude estimation, assume the ability to apply a state preparation unitary \$U\$ and its inverse \$U{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}dagger\$; we give problem instances based on trace estimation where no algorithm which uses only \$U\$ beats the naive, quadratically slower approach. Our proof of this is simple and goes through the compressed oracle method introduced by Zhandry. Since these two subroutines are responsible for the ubiquity of the quadratic "Grover" speedup in quantum algorithms, our result explains why such speedups are far harder to come by in the settings of quantum learning, metrology, and sensing. In these settings, \$U\$ models the evolution of an experimental system, so implementing \$U{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}dagger\$ can be much harder -- tantamount to reversing time within the system. Our result suggests a dichotomy: without inverse access, quantum speedups are scarce; with it, quantum speedups abound.},

Here, we demonstrate direct cooling of a superconducting resonator mode using voltage-controllable quantum tunneling of electrons in a nanoscale refrigerator. This result is revealed by a decreased electron temperature at a resonator-coupled probe resistor, even when the electrons in the refrigerator itself are at an elevated temperature. Our conclusions are verified by control experiments and by a good quantitative agreement between a detailed theoretical model and the direct experimental observations in a broad range of operation voltages and phonon bath temperatures. In the future, the introduced refrigerator can be integrated with different quantum electric devices, potentially enhancing their performance. For the superconducting quantum computer, for example, it may provide an efficient way of initializing the quantum bits.},

Given finite resources, the Third Law of thermodynamics prohibits perfect cooling; nonetheless, attainable upper bounds for the asymptotic ground state population of a system repeatedly interacting with quantum thermal machines have been derived. These bounds apply within a memoryless (Markovian) setting, in which each refrigeration step proceeds independently of those previous. Here, we expand this framework to study the effects of memory on quantum cooling. By introducing a memory mechanism through a generalized collision model that permits a Markovian embedding, we derive achievable bounds that provide an exponential advantage over the memoryless case. For qubits, our bound coincides with that of heat-bath algorithmic cooling, which our framework generalizes to arbitrary dimensions. We lastly describe the adaptive step-wise optimal protocol that outperforms all standard procedures.},

  abstract = {Memory is the fundamental form of temporal complexity: when present but uncontrollable, it manifests as non-Markovian noise; conversely, if controllable, memory can be a powerful resource for information processing. Memory effects arise from/are transmitted via interactions between a system and its environment; as such, they can be either classical or quantum. From a practical standpoint, quantum processes with classical memory promise near-term applicability: they are more powerful than their memoryless counterpart, yet at the same time can be controlled over significant timeframes without being spoiled by decoherence. However, despite practical and foundational value, apart from simple two-time scenarios, the distinction between quantum and classical memory remains unexplored. Here, we analyse multi-time quantum processes with memory mechanisms that transmit only classical information forward in time. Complementing this analysis, we also study two related -- but simpler to characterise -- sets of processes that could also be considered to have classical memory from a structural perspective, and demonstrate that these lead to remarkably distinct phenomena in the multi-time setting. Subsequently, we systematically stratify the full hierarchy of memory effects in quantum mechanics, many levels of which collapse in the two-time setting, making our results genuinely multi-time phenomena.},

This crucial role of control is exemplified by the third law of thermodynamics, Nernst's unattainability principle, which states that infinite resources are required to cool a system to absolute zero temperature. But what are these resources and how should they be utilized? And how does this relate to Landauer's principle that famously connects information and thermodynamics? We answer these questions by providing a framework for identifying the resources that enable the creation of pure quantum states. We show that perfect cooling is possible with Landauer energy cost given infinite time or control complexity. However, such optimal protocols require complex unitaries generated by an external work source. Restricting to unitaries that can be run solely via a heat engine, we derive a novel Carnot-Landauer limit, along with protocols for its saturation. This generalizes Landauer's principle to a fully thermodynamic setting, leading to a unification with the third law and emphasizes the importance of control in quantum thermodynamics.},

Despite their importance, the dynamics of these processes are far from being understood. We show that the free relaxation to thermal equilibrium follows intrinsically different paths depending on whether it involves the temperature of the system to increase or to decrease. Our theory is exemplified using the recently developed thermal kinematics based on information geometry theory, utilizing three prototypical examples: a two-level system, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and a trapped quantum Brownian particle, in all cases showing faster heating than cooling under the appropriate conditions.

Further, in practice, this makes its application to regional development difficult. Accordingly, this study first conducts a systematic literature review of conceptual papers on RRI. It identifies themes and categorizes them into four domains: drivers, tools, outcomes and barriers. Second, these domains are applied to regional innovation studies. The paper contributes to an increased understanding of RRI and its applications to sustainable regional development as well as how RRI and regional innovation studies can benefit from each other.},

Depending on the considered factorization a quantum state appears either entangled or separable. For pure states we always can switch unitarily between separability and entanglement, however, for mixed states a minimal amount of mixedness is needed. We discuss our general statements in detail for the familiar case of qubits, the GHZ states, Werner states and Gisin states, emphasizing their geometric features. As theorists we use and play with this free choice of factorization, which is naturally fixed for an experimentalist. For theorists it offers an extension of the interpretations and is adequate to generalizations, as we point out in the examples of quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping.},

  abstract = {Superconducting qubit lifetimes must be both long and stable to provide an adequate foundation for quantum computing. This stability is imperiled by two-level systems (TLSs), currently a dominant loss mechanism, which exhibit slow spectral dynamics that destabilize qubit lifetimes on hour timescales. Stability is also threatened at millisecond timescales, where ionizing radiation has recently been found to cause bursts of correlated multi-qubit decays, complicating quantum error correction. Here we study both ionizing radiation and TLS dynamics on a 27-qubit processor, repurposing the standard transmon qubits as sensors of both radiation impacts and TLS dynamics. Unlike prior literature, we observe resilience of the qubit lifetimes to the transient quasiparticles generated by the impact of radiation. However, we also observe a new interaction between these two processes, "TLS scrambling," in which a radiation impact causes multiple TLSs to jump in frequency, which we suggest is due to the same charge rearrangement sensed by qubits near a radiation impact. As TLS scrambling brings TLSs out of or in to resonance with the qubit, the lifetime of the qubit increases or decreases. Our findings thus identify radiation as a new contribution to fluctuations in qubit lifetimes, with implications for efforts to characterize and improve device stability},

  abstract = {A variety of tasks in quantum control, ranging from purification and cooling, to quantum stabilization and open-system simulation, rely on the ability to implement a target quantum channel over a specified time interval within prescribed accuracy. This can be achieved by engineering a suitable unitary dynamics of the system of interest along with its environment -- which, depending on the available level of control, is fully or partly exploited as a coherent quantum controller. After formalizing a controllability framework for completely positive trace-preserving quantum dynamics, we provide sufficient conditions on the environment state and dimension that allow for the realization of relevant classes of quantum channels -- including extreme channels, stochastic unitaries, or simply any channel. The results hinge on generalizations of Stinespring's dilation via a subsystem principle. In the process, we show that a conjecture by Lloyd on the minimal dimension of the environment required for arbitrary open-system simulation, albeit formally disproved, can in fact be salvaged -- provided that classical randomization is included among the available resources. Existing measurement-based feedback protocols for universal simulation, dynamical decoupling, and dissipative state preparation are recast within the proposed coherent framework as concrete applications, and the resources they employ discussed in the light of the general results.},

However, the available experimental data shows that realistic errors in modern multi-qubit devices are typically neither independent nor identical across qubits. In this work, we develop and investigate the properties of topological surface codes adapted to a known noise structure by Clifford conjugations. We show that the surface code locally tailored to non-uniform single-qubit noise in conjunction with a scalable matching decoder yields an increase in error thresholds and exponential suppression of sub-threshold failure rates when compared to the standard surface code. Furthermore, we study the behaviour of the tailored surface code under local two-qubit noise and show the role that code degeneracy plays in correcting such noise. The proposed methods do not require additional overhead in terms of the number of qubits or gates and use a standard matching decoder, hence come at no extra cost compared to the standard surface-code error correction.},

We show that when both detectors interact via delta-coupling, one can arrange and tune the detectors so that the channel capacity is (at least) as good as the quantum channel constructed nonperturbatively using {\textbackslash}textit\{gapless detectors\} by Landulfo [PRD 93, 104019]. Furthermore, we prove that this channel capacity is in fact optimal, i.e., both nonperturbative methods give essentially the same channel capacity, thus there is a sense in which the two methods can be regarded as equivalent as far as relativistic quantum communication is concerned.},

With some modifications, we show that existing results about the existence of a spin-boson ground state can be adapted to the Unruh-DeWitt model. In the most relevant scenario involving massless scalar fields in (3+1)-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetimes, where the Unruh-DeWitt model describes a simplified model of light-matter interaction, we argue that common choices of the spacetime smearing functions regulate the ultraviolet behaviour of the model but can still exhibit infrared divergences. In particular, this implies the well-known expectation that the joint interacting Hilbert space of the model cannot be described by the tensor product of a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space and the Fock space of the vacuum representation. We discuss the conditions under which this problem does not arise and the relevance of the operator-algebraic approach for better understanding of particle detector models and their applications. Our work clarifies the connection between obstructions due to Haag's theorem and infrared bosons in the spin-boson models, and paves the way for more rigorous study of entanglement and communication in the UDW framework involving multiple detectors.},

  abstract = {Light-matter interaction is naturally described by coupled bosonic and fermionic subsystems. This suggests that a certain Bose-Fermi duality is naturally present in the fundamental quantum mechanical description of photons interacting with atoms. We reveal submanifolds in parameter space of a basic light-matter interacting system where this duality is promoted to a supersymmetry (SUSY) which remains unbroken. We show that SUSY is robust with respect to decoherence and dissipation. In particular, a stationary density matrix at the supersymmetric lines in the parameter space has a degenerate subspace. A dimension of this subspace is given by the Witten index and thus topologically protected. As a consequence of this SUSY, dissipative dynamics at the supersymmetric lines is constrained by an additional conserved quantity which translates some part of information about an initial state into the stationary state subspace. We also demonstrate a robustness of this additional conserved quantity away from the supersymmetric lines. In addition, we demonstrate that the same SUSY structures are present in condensed matter systems with spin-orbit couplings of Rashba and Dresselhaus types, and therefore spin-orbit coupled systems at the SUSY lines should be robust with respect to various types of disorder and decoherences. Our findings suggest that optical and condensed matter systems at the SUSY points can be used for quantum information technology and can open an avenue for quantum simulation of the SUSY field theories.},

Twisted bilayer graphene has been found to show correlated phases as well as superconductivity related to such flat bands.

These recent key developments are merging to a flourishing research topic: understanding the possible connection and ramifications of quantum geometry on the induced superconductivity and superfluidity in moir{\textbackslash}'e multilayer and other flat band systems. This article presents an introduction to how quantum geometry governs superfluidity in platforms including, and beyond, graphene.

Ultracold gases are introduced as a complementary platform for quantum geometric effects and a comparison is made to moir{\textbackslash}'e materials.

The significance of the full quantum geometry, including the amplitude distance characterized by the quantum metric, has started to receive attention in the last few years. Various quantum transport and interaction phenomena have been found to be critically influenced by quantum geometry. For example, quantum geometry allows counterintuitive flow of supercurrent in a flat band where single electrons are immobile. In this Essay, I will discuss my view of the important open problems and future applications of this research topic and will try to inspire the reader to come up with further ideas. At its best, quantum geometry can open a new chapter in band theory and lead to breakthroughs as transformative as room-temperature superconductivity. However, first, more experiments directly showing the effect of quantum geometry are needed. We also have to integrate quantum geometry analysis in our most advanced numerical methods. Further, the ramifications of quantum geometry should be studied in a wider range, including electric and electromagnetic responses and interaction phenomena in free- and correlated-electron materials, bosonic systems, optics, and other fields.},

In the thermodynamic limit and at low-frequencies, we show that the distribution function of the photonic mode is thermal, with an effective temperature set by the atom-photon interaction strength. This behavior characterizes the static and dynamic critical exponents of the associated superradiance transition. Motivated by these considerations, we develop a general Keldysh path integral approach, that allows us to study physically relevant nonlinearities beyond the idealized Dicke model. Using standard diagrammatic techniques, we take into account the leading-order corrections due to the finite number of atoms N. For finite N, the photon mode behaves as a damped, classical non-linear oscillator at finite temperature. For the atoms, we propose a Dicke action that can be solved for any N and correctly captures the atoms' depolarization due to dissipative dephasing.}

By integrating over and then tracing out the inaccessible modes of the localized field being used as a probe, we show that, at leading order in perturbation theory, the dynamics of any finite number of modes of the probe field is exactly that of a finite number of harmonic-oscillator Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors. The equivalence is valid for a rather general class of input states of the probe-target field system, as well as for any arbitrary number of modes included as detectors. The path integral also provides a closed-form expression which gives us a systematic way of obtaining the corrections to the UDW model at higher orders in perturbation theory due to the existence of the additional modes that have been traced out. This approach vindicates and extends a recently proposed bridge between detector-based and field-theory-based measurement frameworks for quantum field theory [arXiv:2308.11698], and also points to potential connections between particle detector models in RQI and other areas of physics where path integral methods are more commonplace -- in particular, the Wilsonian approach to the renormalization group and effective field theories.},

  abstract = {We summarise important recent advances in quantum metrology, in connection to experiments in cold gases, trapped cold atoms and photons. First we review simple metrological setups, such as quantum metrology with spin squeezed states, with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, Dicke states and singlet states. We calculate the highest precision achievable in these schemes. Then, we present the fundamental notions of quantum metrology, such as shot-noise scaling, Heisenberg scaling, the quantum Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. Using these, we demonstrate that entanglement is needed to surpass the shot-noise scaling in very general metrological tasks with a linear interferometer. We discuss some applications of the quantum Fisher information, such as how it can be used to obtain a criterion for a quantum state to be a macroscopic superposition. We show how it is related to the the speed of a quantum evolution, and how it appears in the theory of the quantum Zeno effect. Finally, we explain how uncorrelated noise limits the highest achievable precision in very general metrological tasks.},

  abstract = {Isolation of a system from its environment is often desirable, from precision measurements to control of individual quantum systems; however, dissipation can also be a useful resource. Remarkably, engineered dissipation enables the preparation of quantum states of atoms, ions or superconducting qubits as well as their stabilization. This is achieved by a suitably engineered coupling to a dissipative cold reservoir formed by electromagnetic modes. Similarly, in the field of cavity electro- and optomechanics, the control over mechanical oscillators utilizes the inherently cold, dissipative nature of the electromagnetic degree of freedom. Breaking from this paradigm, recent theoretical work has considered the opposite regime in which the dissipation of the mechanical oscillator dominates and provides a cold, dissipative reservoir to an electromagnetic mode. Here we realize this reversed dissipation regime in a microwave cavity optomechanical system and realize a quasi-instantaneous, cold reservoir for microwave light. Coupling to this reservoir enables to manipulate the susceptibility of the microwave cavity, corresponding to dynamical backaction control of the microwave field. Additionally, we observe the onset of parametric instability, i.e. the stimulated emission of microwaves (masing). Equally important, the reservoir can function as a useful quantum resource. We evidence this by employing the engineered cold reservoir to implement a large gain (above 40 dB) phase preserving microwave amplifier that operates 0.87 quanta above the limit of added noise imposed by quantum mechanics. Such a dissipative cold reservoir forms the basis of microwave entanglement schemes, the study of dissipative quantum phase transitions, amplifiers with unlimited gain-bandwidth product and non-reciprocal devices, thereby extending the available toolbox of quantum-limited microwave manipulation techniques.},

  abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.},

  abstract = {The theory of large deviations deals with the probabilities of rare events (or fluctuations) that are exponentially small as a function of some parameter, e.g., the number of random components of a system, the time over which a stochastic system is observed, the amplitude of the noise perturbing a dynamical system or the temperature of a chemical reaction. The theory has applications in many different scientific fields, ranging from queuing theory to statistics and from finance to engineering. It is also increasingly used in statistical physics for studying both equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. In this context, deep analogies can be made between familiar concepts of statistical physics, such as the entropy and the free energy, and concepts of large deviation theory having more technical names, such as the rate function and the scaled cumulant generating function. The first part of these notes introduces the basic elements of large deviation theory at a level appropriate for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in physics, engineering, chemistry, and mathematics. The focus there is on the simple but powerful ideas behind large deviation theory, stated in non-technical terms, and on the application of these ideas in simple stochastic processes, such as sums of independent and identically distributed random variables and Markov processes. Some physical applications of these processes are covered in exercises contained at the end of each section. In the second part, the problem of numerically evaluating large deviation probabilities is treated at a basic level. The fundamental idea of importance sampling is introduced there together with its sister idea, the exponential change of measure. Other numerical methods based on sample means and generating functions, with applications to Markov processes, are also covered.},

The motivation is to develop a technology to systematize the extraction of Feynman graphs from string theory amplitudes at higher genus. An important technical input from tropical geometry is the use of tropical theta functions with characteristics to rigorously derive the worldline limit of the worldsheet propagator. This enables us to perform a non-trivial computation at two loops: we derive the tropical form of the integrand of the genus-two four-graviton type II string amplitude, which matches the direct field theory computations. At the mathematical level, this limit is an implementation of the correspondence between the moduli space of Riemann surfaces and the tropical moduli space.}

  abstract = {The dynamical convergence of a system to the thermal distribution, or Gibbs state, is a standard assumption across all of the physical sciences. The Gibbs state is determined just by temperature and the system's energies alone. But at decreasing system sizes, i.e. for nanoscale and quantum systems, the interaction with their environments is not negligible. The question then arises: Is the system's steady state still the Gibbs state? And if not, how may the steady state depend on the interaction details? Here we provide an overview of recent progress on answering these questions. We expand on the state-of-the-art along two general avenues: First we take the static point-of-view which postulates the so-called mean force Gibbs state. This view is commonly adopted in the field of strong coupling thermodynamics, where modified laws of thermodynamics and non-equilibrium fluctuation relations are established on the basis of this modified state. Second, we take the dynamical point-of-view, originating from the field of open quantum systems, which examines the time-asymptotic steady state within two paradigms. We describe the mathematical paradigm which proves return to equilibrium, i.e. convergence to the mean force Gibbs state, and then discuss a number of microscopic physical methods, particularly master equations. We conclude with a summary of established links between statics and equilibration dynamics, and provide an extensive list of open problems. This comprehensive overview will be of interest to researchers in the wider fields of quantum thermodynamics, open quantum systems, mesoscopic physics, statistical physics and quantum optics, and will find applications whenever energy is exchanged on the nanoscale, from quantum chemistry and biology, to magnetism and nanoscale heat management.},

For one, we find a necessary graph theoretic criterion--the "siblings-on-cycles" property--for a causal structure to be admissible: Only such causal structures admit a realization consistent with local quantum theory. We conjecture that this property is moreover sufficient. This conjecture is motivated by an explicit construction of quantum causal models, and supported by numerical calculations. We show that these causal models, in a restricted setting, are indeed consistent. For another, we identify two sets of causal structures that, in the classical-deterministic case, give rise to causal and non-causal correlations respectively.},

We find that the engine power can be enhanced by the coherence in the nonlinear response regime, when the symmetry of coupling configurations between dots and two baths is broken. In the symmetric case, the coherence cannot be maintained in the steady state, except for the maximum interference degenerate case, where initial-condition-dependent multiple steady states appear with a dark state.}

Consider a unitary transporting conserved quantities (``charges'') between two systems initialized in thermal states. Three common formulas model the entropy produced. They respectively cast entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable, as an information-theoretic uncertainty measure, and as a quantifier of irreversibility. Often, the charges are assumed to commute with each other (e.g., energy and particle number). Yet quantum charges can fail to commute. Noncommutation invites generalizations, which we posit and justify, of the three formulas. The noncommutation of charges, we find, breaks the equivalence of the formulas. Furthermore, different formulas quantify different physical effects of the noncommutation of charges on entropy production. For instance, entropy production can signal contextuality---true nonclassicality---by becoming nonreal. This work opens up stochastic thermodynamics to noncommuting---and so particularly quantum---charges.}

Yet, position-momentum correlations have received little systematic attention. Motivated by recent developments in bosonic quantum physics that underscore their relevance in quantum thermodynamics, metrology, and computing, we establish a general framework to study and quantify position-momentum correlations in quantum states. We introduce symplectic coherence, a faithful and easily computable measure defined as the Frobenius norm of the block of the covariance matrix encoding position-momentum correlations, and demonstrate that symplectic coherence is monotone under relevant operations and robust under small perturbations. Furthermore, using a recent mapping by Barthe et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 070604) which relates the covariance matrix of a bosonic state to the density matrix of a finite-dimensional system, we show that position-momentum correlations correspond to beyond-classical correlations in a virtual finite-dimensional quantum state, with symplectic coherence mapping naturally to geometric quantum discord. Taking energy constraints into account, we determine the maximal position-momentum correlations achievable at fixed energy, revealing structural insights about the corresponding optimal states. Finally, we illustrate the operational relevance of symplectic coherence through several examples in quantum information tasks and quantum thermodynamics. In the process, we establish new technical results on matrix norms and quantum covariance matrices, and demonstrate the conceptual significance of viewing covariance matrices as density matrices of virtual quantum states.},

The well-established definition for non-Markovianity of a classical stochastic process represents a condition on the Kolmogorov hierarchy of the n-point joint probability distributions. Since this definition cannot be transferred to the quantum regime, quantum non-Markovianity has recently been defined and quantified in terms of the underlying quantum dynamical map, using either its divisibility properties or the behavior of the trace distance between pairs of initial states. Here, we investigate and compare these definitions and their relations to the classical notion of non-Markovianity by employing a large class of non-Markovian processes, known as semi-Markov processes, which admit a natural extension to the quantum case. A number of specific physical examples is constructed which allow to study the basic features of the classical and the quantum definitions and to evaluate explicitly the measures for quantum non-Markovianity. Our results clearly demonstrate several fundamental distinctions between the classical and the quantum notion of non-Markovianity, as well as between the various quantum measures for non-Markovianity.},

  abstract = {Universal embezzlers are bipartite quantum systems from which any entangled state may be extracted to arbitrary precision using local operations while perturbing the system arbitrarily little. Here we show that a universal embezzler can be created by bipartitioning any local, translation-invariant, critical free-fermionic many-body system on a one-dimensional lattice. The same property holds for locally interacting spin chains that are dual to the critical fermionic models by the Jordan--Wigner transformation. Furthermore, for any finite error and any targeted entangled state, a finite length of the chain is sufficient to embezzle said state within the given error. Hence, universal embezzlement is not restricted to the thermodynamic limit. As well as establishing the ubiquity of universal embezzlers in many-body physics, on a technical level, our main result establishes that the half-chain observable algebras associated with ground-state sectors of the given models are type III1 factors.},

  abstract = {Elucidating the fundamental limitations inherent in physical systems is a central subject in physics. For important thermodynamic operations such as information erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic cost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined error margin. In this study, we introduce the concept of \{{\textbackslash}it separated states\}, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states. This concept generalizes many critical states involved in relevant thermodynamic operations. We uncover a three-way trade-off relation between \{{\textbackslash}it time\}, \{{\textbackslash}it cost\}, and \{{\textbackslash}it error\} for a general class of thermodynamic operations aimed at creating separated states, simply expressed as \${\textbackslash}tau\{{\textbackslash}cal C\}{\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}tau\}{\textbackslash}ge 1-{\textbackslash}eta\$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic operations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a profound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of thermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the quantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of separated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore, we extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Specifically, within Lindblad dynamics, we derive a similar three-way trade-off relation that quantifies the cost of achieving a pure state with a given error. The generalization to general quantum dynamics involving a system coupled to a finite bath implies that heat dissipation becomes infinite as the quantum system is exactly cooled down to the ground state or perfectly reset to a pure state, thereby resolving an open question regarding the thermodynamic cost of information erasure.},

In this Letter, by considering such structural information, we derive a unified topological speed limit for the evolution of physical states using an optimal transport approach. We prove that the minimum time required for changing states is lower bounded by the discrete Wasserstein distance, which encodes the topological information of the system, and the time-averaged velocity. The bound obtained is tight and applicable to a wide range of dynamics, from deterministic to stochastic, and classical to quantum systems. In addition, the bound provides insight into the design principles of the optimal process that attains the maximum speed. We demonstrate the application of our results to chemical reaction networks and interacting many-body quantum systems.}

Although these two areas initially developed separately it has emerged that they are in fact intimately related. In this review I will show how quantum information theory extends traditional information theory by exploring the limits imposed by quantum, rather than classical mechanics on information storage and transmission. The derivation of many key results uniquely differentiates this review from the "usual" presentation in that they are shown to follow logically from one crucial property of relative entropy. Within the review optimal bounds on the speed-up that quantum computers can achieve over their classical counter-parts are outlined using information theoretic arguments. In addition important implications of quantum information theory to thermodynamics and quantum measurement are intermittently discussed. A number of simple examples and derivations including quantum super-dense coding, quantum teleportation, Deutsch's and Grover's algorithms are also included.},

This paper gives a general analysis of the functions quantum internet offer, and then challenges this proposition by arguing that trust, an essential precondition for users to adopt this technology, cannot be guaranteed by technical features alone. Instead, trust is fundamentally a social phenomenon, shaped by how quantum internet is governed, operated, and regulated. Therefore, the ultimate success of quantum internet in fulfilling its promise of secure communication will depend not just on its technical hardware and software but also on the policies and frameworks for running these capacities, and on the public trust in those policies and frameworks. With this argument we arrive at recommendations to decision-makers for developing quantum internet and its governance in a way that quantum internet that can be trusted for its promised capacities.},

  abstract = {This work shows that any \$k\$-local Hamiltonian of qubits can be obtained from a 4-state 'Ising' model with \$k\$-local diagonal interactions and a single-site transverse field -- giving a new theoretical and experimental handle on quantum matter. In particular, the classical Ising interactions can be determined by replacing each Pauli operator with a \$4 {\textbackslash}times 4\$ diagonal matrix. Subsequently tuning a large transverse field projects out two of the four states, recovering the original qubit model, with qudit generalizations. This leads to striking correspondences, such as the spin-1/2 XY and Heisenberg models arising from the large-field limit of 3-state and 4-state Potts models, respectively. Similarly, the Kitaev honeycomb model emerges from classical interactions which enforce loop states on the honeycomb lattice. These generalized Ising models also display rich physics for smaller fields, including quantum criticality and topological phases of matter. This work expands what is experimentally achievable by showing how to realize any quantum spin model using only diagonal interactions and a tuneable field -- ingredients found in, e.g., tweezer arrays of Rydberg atoms or polar molecules. More broadly, 4-state spins can also be encoded in the positions of itinerant particles, exemplified by a Bose-Hubbard model realizing the Kitaev honeycomb model -- giving an experimental path to its \${\textbackslash}mathbb Z\_2\$ and non-Abelian topological quantum liquids.},

  abstract = {The generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) was introduced ten years ago to describe observables in isolated integrable quantum systems after equilibration. Since then, the GGE has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to predict the outcome of the relaxation dynamics of few-body observables in a variety of integrable models, a process we call generalized thermalization. This review discusses several fundamental aspects of the GGE and generalized thermalization in integrable systems. In particular, we focus on questions such as: which observables equilibrate to the GGE predictions and who should play the role of the bath; what conserved quantities can be used to construct the GGE; what are the differences between generalized thermalization in noninteracting systems and in interacting systems mappable to noninteracting ones; why is it that the GGE works when traditional ensembles of statistical mechanics fail. Despite a lot of interest in these questions in recent years, no definite answers have been given. We review results for the XX model and for the transverse field Ising model. For the latter model, we also report original results and show that the GGE describes spin-spin correlations over the entire system. This makes apparent that there is no need to trace out a part of the system in real space for equilibration to occur and for the GGE to apply. In the past, a spectral decomposition of the weights of various statistical ensembles revealed that generalized eigenstate thermalization occurs in the XX model (hard-core bosons). Namely, eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with similar distributions of conserved quantities have similar expectation values of few-spin observables. Here we show that generalized eigenstate thermalization also occurs in the transverse field Ising model.},

We show that, in a single-system multi-time scenario, entanglement-breaking channels are still a quantum memory resource: a qudit going through an entanglement-breaking channel cannot be simulated by a classical system of same dimension. We provide explicit examples of memory-based output generation tasks where entanglement-breaking channels outperform classical memories of the same size.

  abstract = {Understanding the interface between quantum and relativistic theories is crucial for fundamental and practical advances, especially given that key physical concepts such as causality take different forms in these theories. Bell's no-go theorem reveals limits on classical processes, arising from relativistic causality principles. Considering whether similar fundamental limits exist on quantum processes, we derive no-go theorems for quantum experiments realizable in classical background spacetimes. We account for general processes allowed by quantum theory, including those with indefinite causal order (ICO), which have also been the subject of recent experiments. Our first theorem implies that realizations of ICO processes that do not violate relativistic causality must involve the nonlocalization of systems in spacetime. The second theorem shows that for any such realization of an ICO process, there exists a more fine-grained description in terms of a definite and acyclic causal order process. This enables a general reconciliation of quantum and relativistic notions of causality and, in particular, applies to experimental realizations of the quantum switch, a prominent ICO process. By showing what is impossible to achieve in classical spacetimes, these no-go results also offer insights into how causality and information processing may differ in future quantum experiments in relativistic regimes beyond classical spacetimes.}

  abstract = {The notions of events and their localisation fundamentally differ between quantum theory and general relativity, reconciling them becomes even more important and challenging in the context of quantum gravity where a classical spacetime background can no longer be assumed. We therefore propose an operational approach drawing from quantum information, to define events and their localisation relative to a Lab, which in particular includes a choice of physical degree of freedom (the reference) providing a generalised notion of "location". We define a property of the reference, relative measurability, that is sensitive to correlations between the Lab's reference and objects of study. Applying this proposal to analyse the quantum switch (QS), a process widely associated with indefinite causal order, we uncover differences between classical and quantum spacetime realisations of QS, rooted in the relative measurability of the associated references and possibilities for agents' interventions. Our analysis also clarifies a longstanding debate on the interpretation of QS experiments, demonstrating how different conclusions stem from distinct assumptions on the Labs. This provides a foundation for a more unified view of events, localisation, and causality across quantum and relativistic domains.},

  abstract = {Relativistic causality principles constrain information processing possibilities in space-time. No superluminal causation (NSC) and no superluminal signaling (NSS) are two such principles which, although related, are distinct. In this work we study the consequence of these principles by considering the tasks of generating non-classical correlations within two space-time configurations. Considering theories constrained by NSC, we show that the first task is impossible in any classical theory and the second is impossible in any (possibly non-classical) theory. However, we construct a protocol enabling non-classical correlations to be generated in both configurations in a theory restricted by the weaker NSS principle. To do so we exploit theories that allow an effect called jamming. In our realisation, non-communicating agents sharing classical resources and assisted by jamming, can generate PR-box correlations. Using this protocol the violation of NSC without violating NSS would be verifiable. We discuss the implications of these findings for the speed of generation of non-classical correlations. Our work offers insights into the differences in information processing power of theories constrained by NSC, NSS and other relativistic causality principles.},

There is no unique way to measure localization, and individual measures can reflect different aspects of the same quantum state. Here, we present a general scheme to define localization in measure spaces, which is based on what we call R\${\textbackslash}backslash\$'enyi occupations, from which any measure of localization can be derived. We apply this scheme to the four-dimensional unbounded phase space of the interacting spin-boson Dicke model. In particular, we make a detailed comparison of two localization measures based on the Husimi function in the regime where the model is chaotic, namely one that projects the Husimi function over the finite phase space of the spin and another that uses the Husimi function defined over classical energy shells. We elucidate the origin of their differences, showing that in unbounded spaces the definition of maximal delocalization requires a bounded reference subspace, with different selections leading to contextual answers.}

Instead it was argued that gravity (general relativity) emerges from quantum field theory in roughly the same sense that hydrodynamics or continuum elasticity theory emerges from molecular physics.

  abstract = {We present a formulation of the quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) which govern the evolution of neutrino flavor at high density and temperature. Here, the QKEs are derived from the ground up, using fundamental neutrino interactions and quantum field theory. We show that the resulting QKEs describe coherent flavor evolution with an effective mass when inelastic scattering is negligible. The QKEs also contain a collision term. This term can reduce to the collision term in the Boltzmann equation when scattering is dominant and the neutrino effective masses and density matrices become diagonal in the interaction basis. We also find that the QKE's include equations of motion for a new dynamical quantity related to neutrino spin. This quantity decouples from the equations of motion for the density matrices at low densities or in isotropic conditions. However, the spin equations of motion allow for the possibility of coherent transformation between neutrinos and antineutrinos at high densities and in the presence of anisotropy. Although the requisite conditions for this exist in the core collapse supernova and compact object merger environments, it is likely that only a self consistent incorporation of the QKEs in a sufficiently realistic model could establish whether or not significant neutrino-antineutrino conversion occurs.},

  abstract = {Operator square-roots are ubiquitous in theoretical physics. They appear, for example, in the Holstein-Primakoff representation of spin operators and in the Klein-Gordon equation. Often the use of a perturbative expansion is the only recourse when dealing with them. In this work we show that under certain conditions differential equations can be derived which can be used to find perturbatively inaccessible approximations to operator square-roots. Specifically, for the number operator \${\textbackslash}hat n={\textbackslash}hat a{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}dag a\$ we show that the square-root \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}hat n\}\$ near \${\textbackslash}hat n=0\$ can be approximated by a polynomial in \${\textbackslash}hat n\$. This result is unexpected because a Taylor expansion fails. A polynomial expression in \${\textbackslash}hat n\$ is possible because \${\textbackslash}hat n\$ is an operator, and its constituents \$a\$ and \$a{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}dag\$ have a non-trivial commutator \$[a,a{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}dag]=1\$ and do not behave as scalars. We apply our approach to the zero mass Klein-Gordon Hamiltonian in a constant magnetic field, and as a main application, the Holstein-Primakoff representation of spin operators, where we are able to find new expressions that are polynomial in bosonic operators. We prove that these new expressions exactly reproduce spin operators. Our expressions are manifestly Hermitian, which offer an advantage over other methods, such as the Dyson-Maleev representation.},

  abstract = {In recent years, quantum phase transitions have attracted the interest of both theorists and experimentalists in condensed matter physics. These transitions, which are accessed at zero temperature by variation of a non-thermal control parameter, can influence the behavior of electronic systems over a wide range of the phase diagram. Quantum phase transitions occur as a result of competing ground state phases. The cuprate superconductors which can be tuned from a Mott insulating to a d-wave superconducting phase by carrier doping are a paradigmatic example. This review introduces important concepts of phase transitions and discusses the interplay of quantum and classical fluctuations near criticality. The main part of the article is devoted to bulk quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems. Several classes of transitions will be briefly reviewed, pointing out, e.g., conceptual differences between ordering transitions in metallic and insulating systems. An interesting separate class of transitions are boundary phase transitions where only degrees of freedom of a subsystem become critical; this will be illustrated in a few examples. The article is aimed on bridging the gap between high-level theoretical presentations and research papers specialized in certain classes of materials. It will give an overview over a variety of different quantum transitions, critically discuss open theoretical questions, and frequently make contact with recent experiments in condensed matter physics.},

This agrees with the results of Fabrizio \& Gogolin and of Furusaki, but not with those of Oreg and Finkel'stein (probably because we capture effects not included in their mean-field treatment of the Coulomb gas that they obtained by an exact mapping; their treatment of anti-commutation relations in this mapping is correct, however, contrary to recent suggestions in the literature). --- The tutorial is addressed to readers unfamiliar with bosonization, or for those interested in seeing ``all the details'' explicitly; it requires knowledge of second quantization only, not of field theory. At the same time, we hope that experts too might find useful our explicit treatment of certain subtleties -- these include the proper treatment of the so-called Klein factors that act as fermion-number ladder operators (and also ensure the anti-commutation of different species of fermion fields), the retention of terms of order 1/L, and a novel, rigorous formulation of finite-size refermionization of both \$e{\textasciicircum}\{-i {\textbackslash}backslashPhi(x)\}\$ and the boson field \${\textbackslash}backslashPhi (x)\$ itself.}

For classical systems, trade-offs between these characteristics and thermodynamic costs, such as entropy production and dynamical activity, have been established through uncertainty relations. Quantum systems, however, present unique challenges, where quantum coherence can enhance precision and violate classical uncertainty relations. In this study, we derive trade-off relations for stochastic observables in Markovian open quantum systems. Specifically, we present three key results: (i) a quantum generalization of the thermo-kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the relative fluctuations of currents in terms of entropy production and dynamical activity; (ii) a quantum inverse uncertainty relation, which constrains the relative fluctuations of arbitrary counting observables based on their instantaneous fluctuations and the spectral gap of the symmetrized Liouvillian; and (iii) a quantum response kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the response of general observables to kinetic perturbations in terms of dynamical activity. These fundamental bounds, validated numerically using a three-level maser and a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain, provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between precision, response, and thermodynamic costs in quantum systems.},

  abstract = {Gaussian states have played on important role in the physics of continuous-variable quantum systems. They are appealing for the experimental ease with which they can be produced, and for their compact and elegant mathematical description. Nevertheless, many proposed quantum technologies require us to go beyond the realm of Gaussian states and introduce non-Gaussian elements. In this Tutorial, we provide a roadmap for the physics of non-Gaussian quantum states. We introduce the phase-space representations as a framework to describe the different properties of quantum states in continuous-variable systems. We then use this framework in various ways to explore the structure of the state space. We explain how non-Gaussian states can be characterised not only through the negative values of their Wigner function, but also via other properties such as quantum non-Gaussianity and the related stellar rank. For multimode systems, we are naturally confronted with the question of how non-Gaussian properties behave with respect to quantum correlations. To answer this question, we first show how non-Gaussian states can be created by performing measurements on a subset of modes in a Gaussian state. Then, we highlight that these measured modes must be correlated via specific quantum correlations to the remainder of the system to create quantum non-Gaussian or Wigner-negative states. On the other hand, non-Gaussian operations are also shown to enhance or even create quantum correlations. Finally, we will demonstrate that Wigner negativity is a requirement to violate Bell inequalities and to achieve a quantum computational advantage. At the end of the Tutorial, we also provide an overview of several experimental realisations of non-Gaussian quantum states in quantum optics and beyond.},

  abstract = {Quantum energy teleportation (QET) is the phenomenon in which locally inaccessible energy is activated as extractable work through collaborative local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with an entangled partner. It closely resembles the more well-known quantum information teleportation (QIT) where quantum information can be sent through an entangled pair with LOCC. It is tempting to ask how QET is related to QIT. Here we report a first study of this connection. Despite the apparent similarity, we show that these two phenomena are not only distinct but moreover are mutually competitive. We show a perturbative trade-off relation between their performance in a thermal entangled chaotic many-body system, in which both QET and QIT are simultaneously implemented through a traversable wormhole in an emergent spacetime. Motivated by this example, we study a generic setup of two entangled qudits and prove a universal non-perturbative trade-off bound. It shows that for any teleportation protocol, the overall performance of QET and QIT together is constrained by the entanglement resource. We discuss some explanations of our results.},

We propose a secure quantum ranging protocol that combines quantum ranging with quantum position verification (QPV). Our method achieves Heisenberg-limited precision in position estimation while simultaneously detecting potential cheaters. Two verifiers each send out a state that is entangled in frequency space within a single optical mode. An honest prover only needs to perform simple beam-splitter operations, whereas cheaters are allowed to use arbitrary linear optical operations, one ancillary mode, and perfect quantum memories-though without access to entanglement. Our approach considers a previously unstudied security aspect to quantum ranging. It also provides a framework to quantify the precision with which a prover's position can be verified in QPV, which previously has been assumed to be infinite.},

Its cooling upper bound has been recently found using a specific algorithm, the partner pairing algorithm (PPA-HBAC). It has been shown that by including cross-relaxation, it is possible to surpass the cooling bounds. Herein, by combining cross-relaxation and decoherence-free subspace, we present a two-qubit reset sequence and then generate a new algorithmic cooling (AC) technique using irreversible polarization compression to further surpass the bound. The proposed two-qubit reset sequence can prepare one of the two qubits to four times the polarization of a single-qubit reset operation in PPA-HBAC for low polarization. When the qubit number is large, the cooling limit of the proposed AC is approximately five times as high as the PPA-HBAC. The results reveal that cross-relaxation and decoherence-free subspace are promising resources to create new AC for higher polarization.},

  abstract = {Quantum entanglement---correlations of particles that are stronger than any classical analog---is the basis for research on the foundations of quantum mechanics and for practical applications such as quantum networks. Traditionally, entanglement is achieved through local interactions or via entanglement swapping, where entanglement at a distance is generated through previously established entanglement and Bell-state measurements. However, the precise requirements enabling the generation of quantum entanglement without traditional local interactions remain less explored. Here, we demonstrate that independent particles can be entangled without the need for direct interaction, prior established entanglement, or Bell-state measurements, by exploiting the indistinguishability of the origins of photon pairs. Our demonstrations challenge the long-standing belief that the prior generation and measurement of entanglement are necessary prerequisites for generating entanglement between independent particles that do not share a common past. In addition to its foundational interest, we show that this technique might lower the resource requirements in quantum networks, by reducing the complexity of photon sources and the overhead photon numbers.}

Observation of a change in the net charge of the particle coincident with the recoil allows decays to be identified with background levels at the micro-Becquerel level.

Using a compelling set of examples, from gene networks and ant colonies to human language and the degradation of diverse ecosystems, the book illustrates the power of simple models to reveal how phase transitions occur. Introductory chapters provide the critical concepts and the simplest mathematical techniques required to study phase transitions. In a series of example-driven chapters, Ricard Sol{\'e} shows how such concepts and techniques can be applied to the analysis and prediction of complex system behavior, including the origins of life, viral replication, epidemics, language evolution, and the emergence and breakdown of societies.

Large-size scaling behavior for the quantum discord itself is observed, which has never been reported in another critical system. A logarithmic diverging behavior for the first derivative of the quantum discord is also found in both models, which might be universal in the second-order quantum phase transition. It is suggested that the pronounced maximum or minimum of first derivative of quantum discord signifies the critical point. Comparisons between the quantum discord and the scaled concurrence are performed. It is shown that the quantum discord is very small in one phase and robust in the other phase, while the scaled concurrence shows maximum at the critical point and decays rapidly when away from the the critical point.}

  abstract = {The single-mode Dicke model is well-known to undergo a quantum phase transition from the so-called normal phase to the supperradiant phase (hereinafter called the "superradiant quantum phase transition"). Normally, quantum phase transitions are closely related to the critical behavior of quantities such as entanglement, quantum fluctuations, and fidelity. In this paper, we study quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the field mode and that of the atoms in the ground state of the Dicke Hamiltonian. For finite and large enough number of atoms, our numerical results show that near the critical atom-field coupling, the QFIs of the atomic and the field subsystems can surpass the classical limits, due to the appearance of nonclassical squeezed states. As the coupling increases far beyond the critical point, the two subsystems are in highly mixed states, which degrade the QFI and hence the ultimate phase sensitivity. In the thermodynamic limit, we present analytical results of the QFIs and their relationships with the reduced variances. For each subsystem, we find that there is a singularity in the derivative of the QFI at the critical point, a clear signature of quantum criticality in the Dicke model.}

An exact solution is given when the ratio \${\textbackslash}eta\$ between the cavity and mechanical frequencies tends to infinity. This solution reveals a coherent photon occupation in the ground state by breaking continuous or discrete symmetries, exhibiting an equilibrium quantum phase transition (QPT). In the \$U(1)\$-broken phase, an unstable Goldstone mode can be excited. In the model featuring \$Z\_2\$ symmetry, we discover the mutually (in the finite \${\textbackslash}eta\$) or unidirectionally (in \${\textbackslash}eta {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty\$) dependent relation between the squeezed vacuum of the cavity and mechanical modes. In particular, when the cavity is driven by a squeezed field along the required squeezing parameter, it enables modifying the region of \$Z\_2\$-broken phase and significantly reducing the coupling strength to reach QPTs. Furthermore, by coupling atoms to the cavity mode, the hybrid system can undergo a QPT at a hybrid critical point, which is cooperatively determined by the optomechanical and light-atom systems. These results suggest that this optomechanical system complements other phase transition models for exploring novel critical phenomena.},

Previous works identified the free energy of the input state as the optimal rate of extractable work under the crucial assumption: experimenters know the description of the given quantum state, which restricts the applicability to significantly limited settings. Here, we show that this optimal extractable work can be achieved without knowing the input states at all, removing the aforementioned fundamental operational restrictions. We achieve this by presenting a universal work extraction protocol, whose description does not depend on input states but nevertheless extracts work quantified by the free energy of the unknown input state. Remarkably, our result partially encompasses the case of infinite-dimensional systems, for which optimal extractable work has not been known even for the standard state-aware setting. Our results clarify that, in spite of the crucial difference between the state-aware and state-agnostic scenarios in accomplishing information-theoretic tasks, whether we are in possession of information on the given state does not influence the optimal performance of the asymptotic work extraction.},

  abstract = {The Quantum Max Cut (QMC) problem has emerged as a test-problem for designing approximation algorithms for local Hamiltonian problems. In this paper we attack this problem using the algebraic structure of QMC, in particular the relationship between the quantum max cut Hamiltonian and the representation theory of the symmetric group. The first major contribution of this paper is an extension of non-commutative Sum of Squares (ncSoS) optimization techniques to give a new hierarchy of relaxations to Quantum Max Cut. The hierarchy we present is based on optimizations over polynomials in the qubit swap operators. This is in contrast to the "standard" quantum Lasserre Hierarchy, which is based on polynomials expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices. To prove correctness of this hierarchy, we exploit a finite presentation of the algebra generated by the qubit swap operators. This presentation allows for the use of computer algebraic techniques to manipulate and simplify polynomials written in terms of the swap operators, and may be of independent interest. Surprisingly, we find that level-2 of this new hierarchy is numerically exact (up to tolerance 10{\textasciicircum}(-7)) on all QMC instances with uniform edge weights on graphs with at most 8 vertices. The second major contribution of this paper is a polynomial-time algorithm that computes (in exact arithmetic) the maximum eigenvalue of the QMC Hamiltonian for certain graphs, including graphs that can be "decomposed" as a signed combination of cliques. A special case of the latter are complete bipartite graphs with uniform edge-weights, for which exact solutions are known from the work of Lieb and Mattis. Our methods, which use representation theory of the symmetric group, can be seen as a generalization of the Lieb-Mattis result.},

  abstract = {The science of quantum information has arisen over the last two decades centered on the manipulation of individual quanta of information, known as quantum bits or qubits. Quantum computers, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation are among the most celebrated ideas that have emerged from this new field. It was realized later on that using continuous-variable quantum information carriers, instead of qubits, constitutes an extremely powerful alternative approach to quantum information processing. This review focuses on continuous-variable quantum information processes that rely on any combination of Gaussian states, Gaussian operations, and Gaussian measurements. Interestingly, such a restriction to the Gaussian realm comes with various benefits, since on the theoretical side, simple analytical tools are available and, on the experimental side, optical components effecting Gaussian processes are readily available in the laboratory. Yet, Gaussian quantum information processing opens the way to a wide variety of tasks and applications, including quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and quantum state and channel discrimination. This review reports on the state of the art in this field, ranging from the basic theoretical tools and landmark experimental realizations to the most recent successful developments. {\copyright} 2012 American Physical Society.}

With this definition of a physical state, even in entangled states nothing that is done in one isolated system can instantaneously effect the physical state of a distant isolated system. This change in the description of physical states opens up a large variety of new ways that the density matrix may transform under various symmetries, different from the unitary transformations of ordinary quantum mechanics. Such new transformation properties have been explored before, but so far only for the symmetry of time translations into the future, treated as a semi-group. Here new transformation properties are studied for general symmetry transformations forming groups, rather than semi-groups. Arguments are given that such symmetries should act on the density matrix as in ordinary quantum mechanics, but loopholes are found for all of these arguments.}

It has been predicted by Dicke in 1954 and only recently observed in cold atomic vapors. Here we address the question to what extend this cooperative effect survives outside the limit of frozen two-level systems by studying the subradiant decay in an ensemble of cold atoms as a function of the temperature. Experimentally, we observe only a slight decrease of the subradiant decay time when increasing the temperature up to several millikelvins, and in particular we measure subradiant decay rates that are much smaller than the Doppler broadening. This demonstrates that subradiance is surprisingly robust against thermal decoherence. The numerical simulations are in good agreement and allow us to extrapolate the behavior of subradiance at higher temperatures.},

  abstract = {Our experience of the world around us is governed almost entirely by light--matter interactions. At the most fundamental level, such interactions are described by quantum electrodynamics (QED), a well-established theory that has stood up to decades of experimental testing to remarkable degrees of precision. However, the complexity of real systems almost always means that the quantum electrodynamical equations describing a given scenario are often infeasible or impractical to solve. Thus, a sequence of approximations and idealisations are made, in order to build up from the simple case of an isolated electron interacting with a gauge field leading to the deceptively simple laws governing reflection and refraction at mirrors and lenses. This review provides a pedagogical overview of this journey, concentrating on cases where external boundary conditions can be used as a control method. Beginning from the fundamental Lagrangian, topics include gauge freedom, perturbative macroscopic QED descriptions of spontaneous decay, Casimir--Polder forces, resonant energy transfer, interatomic Coulombic decay, all of which are described in terms of the dyadic Green's tensor that solves the Helmholtz equation. We discuss in detail how to calculate this tensor in practical situations before outlining new techniques in the design and optimisation of perturbative light--matter interactions, highlighting some recent advances in free-form, unconstrained inverse design of optical devices. Finally, an outlook towards the frontiers in the interaction of quantum light with matter is given, including its interface with chemical reactivity via polaritonic chemistry and quantum chemistry via quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT).},

Nature does not care about our confusion and diamagnetism exists and physics is constrained by the requirements of causality (that effect cannot precede its cause). This puzzle has received intermittent attention from time to time, with a variety of arguments made to resolve the paradox. None of these, no matter how plausible, reveal the mechanism that resolves the existence of diamagnetism without sacrificing causality. The full resolution is presented in this letter.},

Here we ask, what is the maximum efficiency of an irreversible device with finite power output? We use a nonlinear scattering theory to answer this question for thermoelectric quantum systems; heat engines or refrigerators consisting of nanostructures or molecules that exhibit a Peltier effect. We find that quantum mechanics places an upper bound on both power output, and on the efficiency at any finite power. The upper bound on efficiency equals Carnot efficiency at zero power output, but decays with increasing power output. It is intrinsically quantum (wavelength dependent), unlike Carnot efficiency. This maximum efficiency occurs when the system lets through all particles in a certain energy window, but none at other energies. A physical implementation of this is discussed, as is the suppression of efficiency by a phonon heat flow.}

The bulk theory is described by the \$O(2)\$ symmetric Wilson-Fisher conformal field theory, and we model the impurity by a localized spin-1/2 degree of freedom. We also consider a generalized model by considering an \$O(N)\$ symmetric bulk theory coupled to a spin-\$S\$ degree of freedom. We study this field theory using the \${\textbackslash}backslashepsilon = 3 - d\$ expansion, where the impurity-bulk interaction flows to an infrared stable fixed point at the critical trapping potential. We determine the scaling dimensions of the impurity degree of freedom and the associated critical exponents near the critical point.

  abstract = {Symmetries are crucial for tailoring parametrized quantum circuits to applications, due to their capability to capture the essence of physical systems. In this work, we shift the focus away from incorporating symmetries in the circuit design and towards symmetry-aware training of variational quantum algorithms. For this, we introduce the concept of projected derivatives of parametrized quantum circuits, in particular the equivariant and covariant derivatives. We show that the covariant derivative gives rise to the quantum Fisher information and quantum natural gradient. This provides an operational meaning for the covariant derivative, and allows us to extend the quantum natural gradient to all continuous symmetry groups. Connecting to traditional particle physics, we confirm that our covariant derivative is the same as the one introduced in physical gauge theory. This work provides tools for tailoring variational quantum algorithms to symmetries by incorporating them locally in derivatives, rather than into the design of the circuit.},

  abstract = {The notion of ``fundamental constant'' is heavily theory-laden. A natural, fairly precise formulation is possible in the context of the standard model (here defined to include gravity). Some fundamental constants have profound geometric meaning. The ordinary gravitational constant parameterizes the stiffness, or resistance to curvature, of space-time. The cosmological term parameterizes space-time's resistance to expansion -- which may be, and apparently is at present, a \{{\textbackslash}it negative\} resistance, i.e. a tendency toward expansion. The three gauge couplings of the strong, electromagnetic, and weak interactions parameterize resistance to curvature in internal spaces. The remaining fundamental couplings, of which there are a few dozen, supply an ungainly accommodation of inertia. The multiplicity and variety of fundamental constants are esthetic and conceptual shortcomings in our present understanding of foundational physics. I discuss some ideas for improving the situation. I then briefly discuss additional constants, primarily cosmological, that enter into our best established present-day world model. Those constants presently appear as macroscopic state parameters, i.e. as empirical ``material constants'' of the Universe. I mention a few ideas for how they might become fundamental constants in a future theory. In the course of this essay I've advertised several of my favorite speculations, including a few that might be tested soon.},

We establish in full generality a sufficient and a necessary condition for cooling and show that for a vast class of non-equilibrium resources these two conditions coincide, providing a single necessary and sufficient criterion. Such conditions are expressed in terms of a single function playing a similar role for the third law to the one of the free energy for the second law. From a technical point of view we provide new results about concavity/convexity of certain Renyi-divergences, which might be of independent interest.},

The latter, which quantifies the amount of both classical and quantum correlations, is computed exactly in the two limiting cases of vanishing magnetic field and vanishing temperature. For all other situations, numerical results provide evidence of a finite mutual information at all temperatures except at criticality. There, it diverges as the logarithm of the system size, with a prefactor that can take only two values, depending on whether the critical temperature vanishes or not. Our work provides a simple example in which the mutual information appears as a powerful tool to detect finite-temperature phase transitions, contrary to entanglement measures such as the concurrence.}

We extend this analogy to any nonrelativistic Goldstone mode in a flowing spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. In addition to showing the linear dispersive result for all such modes, we show that the quadratically dispersive modes couple to a special nonrelativistic spacetime called a Newton-Cartan geometry. The kind of spacetime (Einstein-Hilbert or Newton-Cartan) is intimately linked to the mean-field phase of the condensate. To illustrate the general result, we further provide the specific theory in the context of a pseudo-spin-1/2 condensate where we can tune between relativistic and nonrelativistic geometries. We uncover the fate of Hawking radiation upon such a transition: it vanishes and remains absent in the Newton-Cartan geometry despite the fact that any fluid flow creates a horizon for certain wave numbers. Finally, we use the coupling to different spacetimes to compute and relate various energy and momentum currents in these analogue systems. While this result is general, present day experiments can realize these different spacetimes including the magnon modes for spin-1 condensates such as \${\textasciicircum}\{87\}\$Rb, \${\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$Li, \${\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$K (Newton-Cartan), and \${\textasciicircum}\{23\}\$Na (Einstein-Hilbert).},

A necessary condition for this is that the information carried away from the system by the bath (source of the irreversibility) be recoverable. The primary field of application is quantum optics, where the bath consists of the continuum of electromagnetic modes. The information lost from the system can be recovered using a perfect photodetector. The state of the system conditioned on the photodetections undergoes stochastic quantum jumps. Alternative measurement schemes on the outgoing light (homodyne and heterodyne detection) are shown to give rise to SSE's with diffusive terms. These three detection schemes are illustrated on a simple quantum system, the two-level atom, giving new perspectives on the interpretation of measurement results. The reality of these and other stochastic processes for state vectors is discussed.}

Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on \$AdS\_5{\textbackslash}backslashtimes \{{\textbackslash}backslashbf S\}{\textasciicircum}5\$ match with the chiral operators of \${\textbackslash}backslashN=4\$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions.

  abstract = {We investigate the possibility of dividing quantum channels into concatenations of other channels, thereby studying the semigroup structure of the set of completely-positive trace-preserving maps. We show the existence of 'indivisible' channels which can not be written as non-trivial products of other channels and study the set of 'infinitesimal divisible' channels which are elements of continuous completely positive evolutions. For qubit channels we obtain a complete characterization of the sets of indivisible and infinitesimal divisible channels. Moreover, we identify those channels which are solutions of time-dependent master equations for both positive and completely positive evolutions. For arbitrary finite dimension we prove a representation theorem for elements of continuous completely positive evolutions based on new results on determinants of quantum channels and Markovian approximations.},

  abstract = {One of the major resource requirements of computers - ranging from biological cells to human brains to high-performance (engineered) computers - is the energy used to run them. Those costs of performing a computation have long been a focus of research in physics, going back to the early work of Landauer. One of the most prominent aspects of computers is that they are inherently nonequilibrium systems. However, the early research was done when nonequilibrium statistical physics was in its infancy, which meant the work was formulated in terms of equilibrium statistical physics. Since then there have been major breakthroughs in nonequilibrium statistical physics, which are allowing us to investigate the myriad aspects of the relationship between statistical physics and computation, extending well beyond the issue of how much work is required to erase a bit. In this paper I review some of this recent work on the `stochastic thermodynamics of computation'. After reviewing the salient parts of information theory, computer science theory, and stochastic thermodynamics, I summarize what has been learned about the entropic costs of performing a broad range of computations, extending from bit erasure to loop-free circuits to logically reversible circuits to information ratchets to Turing machines. These results reveal new, challenging engineering problems for how to design computers to have minimal thermodynamic costs. They also allow us to start to combine computer science theory and stochastic thermodynamics at a foundational level, thereby expanding both.},

After this I present a central result from modern non-equilibrium statistical physics: an exact expression for the entropy flow out of a system undergoing a given dynamics with a given initial distribution over states. This central expression is crucial for analyzing how the total entropy flow out of a computer depends on its global structure, since that global structure determines the initial distributions into all of the computer's subsystems, and therefore (via the central expression) the entropy flows generated by all of those subsystems. I illustrate these results by analyzing some of the subtleties concerning the benefits that are sometimes claimed for implementing an irreversible computation with a reversible circuit constructed out of Fredkin gates.},

The topology of any such circuit restricts which variables may be physically coupled during the operation of a circuit. We investigate how such restrictions on the physical coupling affects the thermodynamic costs of running the circuit. To do this we first calculate the minimal additional entropy production that arises when we run a given gate in a circuit. We then build on this calculation, to analyze how the thermodynamic costs of implementing a computation with a full circuit, comprising multiple connected gates, depends on the topology of that circuit. This analysis provides a rich new set of optimization problems that must be addressed by any designer of a circuit, if they wish to minimize thermodynamic costs.},

  abstract = {The relationship between the thermodynamic and computational characteristics of dynamical physical systems has been a major theoretical interest since at least the 19th century, and has been of increasing practical importance as the energetic cost of digital devices has exploded over the last half century. One of the most important thermodynamic features of real-world computers is that they operate very far from thermal equilibrium, in finite time, with many quickly (co-)evolving degrees of freedom. Such computers also must almost always obey multiple physical constraints on how they work. For example, all modern digital computers are periodic processes, governed by a global clock. Another example is that many computers are modular, hierarchical systems, with strong restrictions on the connectivity of their subsystems. This properties hold both for naturally occurring computers, like brains or Eukaryotic cells, as well as digital systems. These features of real-world computers are absent in 20th century analyses of the thermodynamics of computational processes, which focused on quasi-statically slow processes. However, the field of stochastic thermodynamics has been developed in the last few decades - and it provides the formal tools for analyzing systems that have exactly these features of real-world computers. We argue here that these tools, together with other tools currently being developed in stochastic thermodynamics, may help us understand at a far deeper level just how the fundamental physical properties of dynamic systems are related to the computation that they perform.},

With this we further explore a way of circumventing the no-go theorem of Eastin and Knill, which states that if local errors are correctable, the group of transversal gates must be of finite order. We are able to do this by introducing a small error on the decoding procedure that decreases with the dimension of the frames used. Furthermore, we show that there is a direct relationship between how small this error can be and how accurate quantum clocks can be: the more accurate the clock, the smaller the error; and the no-go theorem would be violated if time could be measured perfectly in quantum mechanics. The asymptotic scaling of the error is studied under a number of scenarios of reference frames and error models. The scheme is also extended to errors at unknown locations, and we show how to achieve this by simple majority voting related error correction schemes on the reference frames. In the Outlook, we discuss our results in relation to the AdS/CFT correspondence and the Page-Wooters mechanism.},

Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original photon. But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems.},

For single-qubit summoning, we present a protocol based on a Calderbank-Shor-Steane code that decreases the space complexity for encoding by a factor of two compared to the previous best result and reduces the gate complexity from scaling as the cube to the square of the number of causal diamonds. Our protocol includes decoding whose gate complexity scales linearly with the number of causal diamonds. Our thorough framework for quantum summoning enables full specification of the protocol, including spatial and temporal implementation and costs, which enables quantum summoning to be a well posed protocol for relativistic quantum communication purposes.},

  abstract = {Quantum master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of open quantum systems, but their accuracy is rarely compared with the analytical solution of exactly solvable models. In this work, we perform such a comparison for the damped Jaynes-Cummings model of a qubit in a leaky cavity, for which an analytical solution is available in the one-excitation subspace. We consider the non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation up to the second (Redfield) and fourth orders as well as three types of Markovian master equations: the coarse-grained, cumulant, and standard rotating-wave approximation (RWA) Lindblad equations. We compare the exact solution to these master equations for three different spectral densities: impulse, Ohmic, and triangular. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained master equation outperforms the standard RWA-based Lindblad master equation for weak coupling or high qubit frequency (relative to the spectral density high-frequency cutoff \${\textbackslash}omega\_c\$), where the Markovian approximation is valid. In the presence of non-Markovian effects characterized by oscillatory, non-decaying behavior, the TCL approximation closely matches the exact solution for short evolution times (in units of \${\textbackslash}omega\_c{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) even outside the regime of validity of the Markovian approximations. For long evolution times, all master equations perform poorly, as quantified in terms of the trace-norm distance from the exact solution. The fourth-order time-convolutionless master equation achieves the top performance in all cases. Our results highlight the need for reliable approximation methods to describe open-system quantum dynamics beyond the short-time limit.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            We propose an autonomous quantum error correction scheme using squeezed cat (SC) code against excitation loss in continuous-variable systems. Through reservoir engineering, we show that a structured dissipation can stabilize a two-component SC while autonomously correcting the errors. The implementation of such dissipation only requires low-order nonlinear couplings among three bosonic modes or between a bosonic mode and a qutrit. While our proposed scheme is device independent, it is readily implementable with current experimental platforms such as superconducting circuits and trapped-ion systems. Compared to the stabilized cat, the stabilized SC has a much lower dominant error rate and a significantly enhanced noise bias. Furthermore, the bias-preserving operations for the SC have much lower error rates. In combination, the stabilized SC leads to substantially better logical performance when concatenating with an outer discrete-variable code. The surface-SC scheme achieves more than one order of magnitude increase in the threshold ratio between the loss rate               {$\kappa$}               1               and the engineered dissipation rate               {$\kappa$}               2               . Under a practical noise ratio               {$\kappa$}               1               /               {$\kappa$}               2               \,=\,10               -3               , the repetition-SC scheme can reach a 10               -15               logical error rate even with a small mean excitation number of 4, which already suffices for practically useful quantum algorithms.},

The goals are to understand how to precisely quantify the spreading of quantum information and how causality emerges in complex quantum systems. We introduce a general framework to study the dynamics of quantum information, including detection and decoding. We show that the dynamics of quantum information is closely related to operator dynamics in the Heisenberg picture, and, under certain circumstances, can be precisely quantified by the so-called out-of-time ordered correlator{\textasciitilde}(OTOC). The general behavior of OTOC is discussed based on several toy models, including the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, random circuit models, and Brownian models, in which OTOC is analytically tractable. We introduce numerical methods, including exact diagonalization and tensor network methods, to calculate OTOC for generic quantum many-body systems. We also survey current experimental schemes for measuring OTOC in various quantum simulators.},

Focusing on the task of cooling a single qubit given access to \$n\$ separable, thermal qubits with arbitrary energy structure, we answer these questions by giving two new perspectives on this task. Firstly, we show that a set of inequalities related to the energetic structure of the \$n\$ qubit machine determines the optimal cooling protocol, which parts of the machine contribute to this protocol and gives rise to a Carnot-like bound. Secondly, we show that cooling protocols can be represented as perfect matchings on bipartite graphs enabling the optimization of cost functions e.g. gate complexity or dissipation. Our results generalize the algorithmic cooling problem, establish new fundamental bounds on quantum cooling and offer a framework for designing novel autonomous thermal machines and cooling algorithms.},

But remembering that information processing is carried out by physical processes prompts one to wonder what thermodynamic resources are required to compress quantum information and how they constrain one's ability to perform this task. That is, if Alice and Bob only have access to thermal quantum states and clocks with finite accuracy, how well can they measure, encode and decode pure quantum state messages? In this work we examine these questions by modelling Alice's typical measurement as a unitary involving a measurement probe, investigating imperfect timekeeping on encoding and decoding and considering the role of temperature in Bob's appended qubits. In doing so, we derive fidelity bounds for this protocol involving the correlations Alice can form with their measurement probe, the variance of the clock's ticks and the temperature of Bob's qubits. Finally, we give an insight into the entropy produced by these two agents throughout the compression protocol by relating the resources they use to a quantum thermodynamic cooling protocol.},

  abstract = {Thermodynamic cost of communication is a major factor in the thermodynamic cost of real world computers, both biological and digital. However, little is known about the fundamental features of this cost. Addressing this hole in the literature, our first major contribution is a strictly positive lower bound on on the unavoidable entropy production (EP) in any physical system that implements a communication channel. Specifically, we derive a relationship between the rate of information transmission across a channel and the minimal thermodynamic cost incurred by any physical systems that implements that transmission. We use this relationship to show that under certain conditions, transmitting information through multiple, high-noise channels (reverse multiplexing) can be thermodynamically more efficient than using a single, low noise channel. We then address the thermodynamic costs inherent in the computational front-ends and back ends to communication channels, which are used to implement error correcting codes over those channels an essential component of modern communication systems. Our second major contribution is a strictly positive lower bound on the minimal EP of any physical system that implements those encoding and decoding algorithms. We use this bound to make a detailed comparison of the minimal thermodynamic costs across various linear codes and error rates. Because our results are like the second law, applying independently of the physical details of the system, they provide valuable insights into the trade offs between decoding error and thermodynamic efficiency. This gives a deeper understanding of the interplay between algorithmic design of error-correcting codes and physical constraints in communication systems.},

  abstract = {The second law lies at the heart of thermodynamics, characterizing the convertibility of thermodynamic states by a single quantity, the entropy. A fundamental question in quantum information theory is whether one can formulate an analogous second law characterizing the convertibility of resources for quantum information processing. In 2008, a promising formulation was proposed, where quantum-resource convertibility is characterized by the optimal performance of a variant of another fundamental task in quantum information processing, quantum hypothesis testing. The core of this formulation was to prove a lemma that identifies a quantity indicating the optimal performance of this task -- the generalized quantum Stein's lemma -- to seek out a counterpart of the thermodynamic entropy in quantum information processing. However, in 2023, a logical gap was found in the existing proof of the generalized quantum Stein's lemma, throwing into question once again whether such a formulation is possible at all. In this work, we construct a proof of the generalized quantum Stein's lemma by developing alternative techniques to circumvent the logical gap of the existing analysis. With our proof, we redeem the formulation of quantum resource theories equipped with the second law as desired. These results affirmatively settle the fundamental question about the possibility of bridging the analogy between thermodynamics and quantum information theory.},

We construct new local set of operators and compute the entanglement entropy according to this algebra in 2 + 1 dimensions. We find that our proposal would lead to an entanglement entropy that behave very similar to a single scalar degree of freedom if we do not include further centers, but approaches that of a gauge field if we include non-trivial centers. We explore also the situation where the gauge field is Higgsed, and construct a local operator algebra that again requires some deformation. This should give us some insight into interpreting the entanglement entropy in generic gauge theories and perhaps also in gravitational theories.},

  abstract = {Strong nonlinear interactions between quantized excitations are an important resource for quantum technologies based on bosonic oscillator modes. However, most electromagnetic and mechanical nonlinearities arising from intrinsic material properties are far too weak compared to dissipation in the system to allow for nonlinear effects to be observed on the single-quantum level. To overcome this limitation, electromagnetic resonators in both the optical and microwave frequency regimes have been coupled to other strongly nonlinear quantum systems such as atoms and superconducting qubits, allowing for the demonstration of effects such as photon blockade and coherent quantum protocols using the Kerr effect. Here, we demonstrate the realization of the single-phonon nonlinear regime in a solid-state mechanical system. The single-phonon anharmonicity in our system exceeds the decoherence rate by a factor of 6.8, allowing us to use the lowest two energy levels of the resonator as a mechanical qubit, for which we show initialization, readout, and a complete set of direct single qubit gates.

  abstract = {Inferring nonlinear features of quantum states is fundamentally important across quantum information science, but remains challenging due to the intrinsic linearity of quantum mechanics. It is widely recognized that quantum memory and coherent operations help avoid exponential sample complexity, by mapping nonlinear properties onto linear observables over multiple copies of the target state. In this work, we prove that such a conversion is not only sufficient but also necessary. Specifically, we prove that the estimation of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{tr\}({\textbackslash}rho{\textasciicircum}\{k\} O)\$ for a broad class of observables \$O\$ is exponentially hard for any protocol restricted to \$(k-1)\$-replica joint measurements, whereas access to one additional replica reduces the complexity to a constant. These results establish, for the first time, an exponential separation between \$(k-1)\$- and \$k\$-replica protocols for any integer \$k{$>$}2\$, thereby introducing a fine-grained hierarchy of replica-based quantum advantage and resolving an open question in the literature. The technical core is a general indistinguishability principle showing that any ensemble constructed from large Haar random states via tensor products and mixtures is hard to distinguish from its average. Leveraging this principle, we further prove that \$k\$-replica joint measurements are also necessary for distinguishing rank-\$k\$ density matrices from rank-\$(k-1)\$ ones. Overall, our work delineates sharp boundaries on the power of joint measurements, highlighting resource-complexity trade-offs in quantum learning theory and deepening the understanding of quantum mechanics' intrinsic linearity.},

  abstract = {It is now well-understood that a Lorentz boost of a spatially coherent monochromatic optical beam yields a so-called space-time wave packet (STWP): a propagation-invariant pulsed beam whose group velocity is determined by the relative velocity between the source and observer. Moreover, the Lorentz boost of an STWP is another STWP, whose group velocities are related by the relativistic law for addition of velocities typically associated with massive particles. We present an experimental procedure for testing this prediction in both the subluminal and superluminal regimes that makes use of spatio-temporal Fourier synthesis via a spatial light modulator. Our approach enables realizing the change in temporal bandwidth, the invariance of the spatial bandwidth, the concomitant change in the spatio-temporal wave-packet envelope, and the change in group velocity that all accompany a Lorentz boost of a monochromatic optical beam. The only consequence of the Lorentz boost not captured by this methodology is the Doppler shift in the optical carrier. This work may provide an avenue for further table-top demonstration of relativistic transformations of optical fields.},

  abstract = {Phases of matter with robust ground-state degeneracy, such as the quantum toric code, are known to be capable of robust quantum information storage. Here, we address the converse question: given a quantum error correcting code, when does it define a stable gapped quantum phase of matter, whose ground state degeneracy is robust against perturbations in the thermodynamic limit? We prove that a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code defines such a phase, robust against all few-body perturbations, if its code distance grows at least logarithmically in the number of degrees of freedom, and it exhibits "check soundness". Many constant-rate quantum LDPC expander codes have such properties, and define stable phases of matter with a constant zero-temperature entropy density, violating the third law of thermodynamics. Our results also show that quantum toric code phases are robust to spatially nonlocal few-body perturbations. Similarly, phases of matter defined by classical codes are stable against symmetric perturbations. In the classical setting, we present improved locality bounds on the quasiadiabatic evolution operator between two nearby states in the same code phase.},

In previous research, initialization above 99{\textbackslash}\% fidelity has been achieved at 280 ns. Here, we demonstrate the rapid initialization of a superconducting qubit with a quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR). Photon-assisted tunneling of quasiparticles in the QCR can temporally increase the relaxation time of photons inside the resonator and helps release energy from the qubit to the environment. Experiments using this protocol have shown that 99{\textbackslash}\% of initialization time is reduced to 180 ns. This initialization time depends strongly on the relaxation rate of the resonator, and faster initialization is possible by reducing the resistance of the QCR, which limits the ON/OFF ratio, and by strengthening the coupling between the QCR and the resonator.},

  abstract = {The variational method is a versatile tool for classical simulation of a variety of quantum systems. Great efforts have recently been devoted to its extension to quantum computing for efficiently solving static many-body problems and simulating real and imaginary time dynamics. In this work, we first review the conventional variational principles, including the Rayleigh-Ritz method for solving static problems, and the Dirac and Frenkel variational principle, the McLachlan's variational principle, and the time-dependent variational principle, for simulating real time dynamics. We focus on the simulation of dynamics and discuss the connections of the three variational principles. Previous works mainly focus on the unitary evolution of pure states. In this work, we introduce variational quantum simulation of mixed states under general stochastic evolution. We show how the results can be reduced to the pure state case with a correction term that takes accounts of global phase alignment. For variational simulation of imaginary time evolution, we also extend it to the mixed state scenario and discuss variational Gibbs state preparation. We further elaborate on the design of ansatz that is compatible with post-selection measurement and the implementation of the generalised variational algorithms with quantum circuits. Our work completes the theory of variational quantum simulation of general real and imaginary time evolution and it is applicable to near-term quantum hardware.},

  abstract = {The achievable bounds of cooling quantum systems, and the possibility to violate them is not well-explored experimentally. For example, among the common methods to enhance spin polarization (cooling), one utilizes the low temperature and high-magnetic field condition or employs a resonant exchange with highly polarized spins. The achievable polarization, in such cases, is bounded either by Boltzmann distribution or by energy conservation. Heat-bath algorithmic cooling schemes (HBAC), on the other hand, have shown the possibility to surpass the physical limit set by the energy conservation and achieve a higher saturation limit in spin cooling. Despite, the huge theoretical progress, and few principle demonstrations, neither the existence of the limit nor its application in cooling quantum systems towards the maximum achievable limit have been experimentally verified. Here, we show the experimental saturation of the HBAC limit for single nuclear spins, beyond any available polarization in solid-state spin system, the Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond. We benchmark the performance of our experiment over a range of variable reset polarizations (bath temperatures), and discuss the role of quantum coherence in HBAC.},

  abstract = {Quantum thermodynamics studies how quantum systems and operations may be exploited as sources of work to perform useful thermodynamic tasks. In real-world conditions, the evolution of open quantum systems typically displays memory effects, resulting in a non-Markovian dynamics. The associated information backflow has been observed to provide advantage in certain thermodynamic tasks. However, a general operational connection between non-Markovianity and thermodynamics in the quantum regime has remained elusive. Here, we analyze the role of non-Markovianity in the central task of extracting work via thermal operations from general multitime quantum processes, as described by process tensors. By defining a hierarchy of four classes of extraction protocols, expressed as quantum combs, we reveal three different physical mechanisms (work investment, multitime correlations, and system-environment correlations) through which non-Markovianity increases the work distillable from the process. The advantages arising from these mechanisms are linked precisely to a quantifier of the non-Markovianity of the process. These results show in very general terms how non-Markovianity of any given quantum process is a fundamental resource that unlocks an enhanced performance in thermodynamics.},

While there is more than one way to measure how different two processes are, special care must be taken to ensure quantifiers obey physically desirable conditions such as data processing inequalities. Here, we analyze two classes of distinguishability measures commonly used in general applications of quantum combs. We show that the first class, called Choi divergences, does not satisfy an important data processing inequality, while the second one, which we call generalized divergences, does. We also extend to quantum combs some other relevant results of generalized divergences of quantum channels. Finally, given the properties we proved, we argue that generalized divergences may be more adequate than Choi divergences for distinguishing quantum combs in most of their applications. Particularly, this is crucial for defining monotones for resource theories whose states have a comb structure, such as resource theories of quantum processes and resource theories of quantum strategies.},

To answer this question we first define generalized tensor product structures (gTPS) in terms of observables, as dual pairs of an operator subalgebra \${\textbackslash}cal A\$ and its commutant. Second, we propose an operational criterion of minimal information scrambling at short time scales to dynamically select gTPS. In this way the emergent subsystems are those which maintain the longest informational identity. This strategy is made quantitative by defining a Gaussian scrambling rate in terms of the short-time expansion of an algebraic version of the Out of Time Order Correlation (OTOC) function i.e., the \${\textbackslash}cal A\$-OTOC. The Gaussian scrambling rate is computed analytically for physically important cases of general division into subsystems, and is shown to have an intuitive and compelling physical interpretation in terms of minimizing the interaction strength between subsystems.},

Our proposal is a generalization of the usual categories of algebraic structures used to formulate physical theories (groups, rings, vector spaces...), herein dubbed dimensioned, that can naturally articulate the structure of physical dimension. Our goal in the present work is not so much to define an algebraic theory of physical quantities - this has already been done - but to define a theory of algebra informed by how physical quantities are used in practice. We conclude by studying the dimensioned analogue of Poisson algebras in some detail due to their relevance in Jacobi geometry and classical mechanics.

  abstract = {Local Friendliness (LF) inequalities follow from seemingly reasonable assumptions about reality: (i) ``absoluteness of observed events'' (e.g., every observed event happens for all observers) and (ii) ``local agency'' (e.g., free choices can be made uncorrelated with other events outside their future light cone). Extended Wigner's Friend Scenario (EWFS) thought experiments show that textbook quantum mechanics violates these inequalities. Thus, experimental evidence of these violations would make these two assumptions incompatible. In [Nature Physics 16, 1199 (2020)], the authors experimentally implemented an EWFS, using a photonic qubit to play the role of each of the ``friends'' and measured violations of LF. One may question whether a photonic qubit is a physical system that counts as an ``observer'' and thereby question whether the experiment's outcome is significant. Intending to measure increasingly meaningful violations, we propose using a statistical measure called the ``branch factor'' to quantify the ``observerness'' of the system. We then encode the EWFS as a quantum circuit such that the components of the circuit that define the friend are quantum systems of increasing branch factor. We run this circuit on quantum simulators and hardware devices, observing LF violations as the system sizes scale. As errors in quantum computers reduce the significance of the violations, better quantum computers can produce better violations. Our results extend the state of the art in proof-of-concept experimental violations from branch factor 0.0 to branch factor 16.0. This is an initial result in an experimental program for measuring LF violations at increasingly meaningful branch factors using increasingly more powerful quantum processors and networks. We introduce this program as a fundamental science application for near-term and developing quantum technology.},

Within this framework, temperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the derivation of both canonical and non-canonical distributions from the Entropy Integrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI.

  abstract = {Inspired by natural cooling processes, dissipation has become a promising approach for preparing low-energy states of quantum systems. However, the potential of dissipative protocols remains unclear beyond certain commuting Hamiltonians. This work provides significant analytical and numerical insights into the power of dissipation for preparing the ground state of non-commuting Hamiltonians. For quasi-free dissipative dynamics, including certain 1D spin systems with boundary dissipation, our results reveal a new connection between the mixing time in trace distance and the spectral properties of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, leading to an explicit and sharp bound on the mixing time that scales polynomially with system size. For more general spin systems, we develop a tensor network-based algorithm for constructing the Lindblad jump operator and for simulating the dynamics. Using this algorithm, we demonstrate numerically that dissipative ground state preparation protocols can achieve rapid mixing for certain 1D local Hamiltonians under bulk dissipation, with a mixing time that scales logarithmically with the system size. We then prove the rapid mixing result for certain weakly interacting spin and fermionic systems in arbitrary dimensions, extending recent results for high-temperature quantum Gibbs samplers to the zero-temperature regime. Our theoretical approaches are applicable to systems with singular stationary states, and are thus expected to have applications beyond the specific systems considered in this study.},

Feedback control is an important class of control methods because of its ability to reduce the effects of noise. In this review we give an introductory overview of the various ways in which feedback may be implemented in quantum systems, the theoretical methods that are currently used to treat it, the experiments in which it has been demonstrated to-date, and its applications. In the last few years there has been rapid experimental progress in the ability to realize quantum measurement and control of mesoscopic systems. We expect that the next few years will see further rapid advances in the precision and sophistication of feedback control protocols realized in the laboratory.},

We derive the invariants for local transformations, and connect these local invariants to the coordinates of the 3-Torus. Since different points on the 3-Torus may correspond to the same local equivalence class, we use the Weyl group theory to reduce the symmetry. We show that the local equivalence classes of two-qubit gates are in one-to-one correspondence with the points in a tetrahedron except on the base. We then study the properties of perfect entanglers, that is, the two-qubit operations that can generate maximally entangled states from some initially separable states. We provide criteria to determine whether a given two-qubit gate is a perfect entangler and establish a geometric description of perfect entanglers by making use of the tetrahedral representation of non-local gates. We find that exactly half the non-local gates are perfect entanglers. We also investigate the non-local operations generated by a given Hamiltonian. We first study the gates that can be directly generated by a Hamiltonian. Then we explicitly construct a quantum circuit that contains at most three non-local gates generated by a two-body interaction Hamiltonian, together with at most four local gates generated by single qubit terms. We prove that such a quantum circuit can simulate any arbitrary two-qubit gate exactly, and hence it provides an efficient implementation of universal quantum computation and simulation.},

Quantum phase transitions of this few degree of freedom model is found when the ratio \${\textbackslash}backslasheta\$ of the atom energy scale to the bosonic field frequency approaches infinity. An analytical solution is provided when the two lowest-energy levels are degenerate. According to it, we recognize that the phase diagram of the model consists of three regions: one normal phase and two superradiant phases. The quantum phase transitions between the normal phase and the two superradiant phases are of second order relating to the spontaneous breaking of the discrete \$Z\_\{2\}\$ symmetry. On the other hand, the quantum phase transition between the two different superradiant phases is discontinuous with a phase boundary line relating to the continuous \$U(1)\$ symmetry. For a large enough but finite \${\textbackslash}backslasheta\$, the scaling function and critical exponents are derived analytically and verified numerically, from which the universality class of the model is identified.}

With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.},

We formulate a hardware-independent expression for this limit in the framework of stochastic processes. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the work penalty as a function of the time taken for the protocol and bit reset error.

Here we study how measurement precision can be enhanced through quantum error correction, a general method for protecting a quantum system from the damaging effects of noise. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving the Heisenberg limit using quantum probes subject to Markovian noise, assuming that noiseless ancilla systems are available, and that fast, accurate quantum processing can be performed. When the sufficient condition is satisfied, a quantum error-correcting code can be constructed which suppresses the noise without obscuring the signal; the optimal code, achieving the best possible precision, can be found by solving a semidefinite program.},

Based on these advances, including dynamically-reconfigurable connectivity and fast transversal operations, we present a low-overhead architecture that supports the layout and resource estimation of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. Utilizing recent advances in fault tolerance with transversal gate operations, this architecture achieves a run time speed-up on the order of the code distance \$d\$, which we find directly translates to run time improvements of large-scale quantum algorithms. Our architecture consists of functional building blocks of key algorithmic subroutines, including magic state factories, quantum arithmetic units, and quantum look-up tables. These building blocks are implemented using efficient transversal operations, and we design space-time efficient versions of them that minimize interaction distance, thereby reducing atom move times and minimizing the volume for correlated decoding. We further propose models to estimate their logical error performance. We perform resource estimation for a large-scale implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm, one of the prototypical benchmarks for large-scale quantum algorithms, finding that 2048-bit RSA factoring can be executed with 19 million qubits in 5.6 days, for 1 ms QEC cycle times.

It is based on a new method of robust quantum control, which allows us to simultaneously eliminate the undesired effects associated with spin-spin interactions, disorder and control imperfections, enabling a five-fold enhancement in coherence time compared to conventional control sequences. Combined with optimal initialization and readout protocols, this allows us to break the limit for AC magnetic field sensing imposed by interactions, opening a promising avenue for the development of solid-state ensemble magnetometers with unprecedented sensitivity.},

Quantum illumination, when first proposed, is surprising as entanglement's benefit survives entanglement-breaking noise. Since then, many efforts have been devoted to study quantum sensing in noisy scenarios. The applicability of such schemes, however, is limited to a binary quantum hypothesis testing scenario. In terms of target detection, such schemes interrogate a single polarization-azimuth-elevation-range-Doppler resolution bin at a time, limiting the impact to radar detection. We resolve this binary-hypothesis limitation by proposing a quantum ranging protocol enhanced by entanglement. By formulating a ranging task as a multiary hypothesis testing problem, we show that entanglement enables a 6-dB advantage in the error exponent against the optimal classical scheme. Moreover, the proposed ranging protocol can also be utilized to implement a pulse-position modulated entanglement-assisted communication protocol. Our ranging protocol reveals entanglement's potential in general quantum hypothesis testing tasks and paves the way towards a quantum-ranging radar with a provable quantum advantage.},

Here we prove this phase transition exactly using the path-integral approach based on the faithful Schwinger fermion representation, and give a unified phase boundary condition for these models. We demonstrate that at the phase boundary, the fluctuation of the bosonic field is vanished, thus it can be treated as a classical field, based on which a much simplified method to determine the phase boundary is developed. This explains why the approximated theories by treating the operators as classical variables can yield the exact boundary. We use this method to study several similar spin and boson models, showing its much wider applicability than the previously used approaches. Our results demonstrate that these phase transitions belong to the same universality by the classical Landau theory of phase transitions, which can be confirmed using the platforms in the recent experiments.},

In the homogenizer the system qubit sequentially interacts with the reservoir qubits via the partial swap transformation. The homogenizer realizes, in the limit sense, the transformation such that at the output each qubit is in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the state {$\xi$} irrespective of the initial states of the system and the reservoir qubits. This means that the system qubit undergoes an evolution that has a fixed point, which is the reservoir state {$\xi$}. We also study approximate homogenization when the reservoir is composed of a finite set of identically prepared qubits. The homogenizer allows us to understand various aspects of the dynamics of open systems interacting with environments in nonequilibrium states. In particular, the reversibility vs irreversibility of the dynamics of the open system is directly linked to specific (classical) information about the order in which the reservoir qubits interacted with the system qubit. This aspect of the homogenizer leads to a model of a quantum safe with a classical combination. We analyze in detail how entanglement between the reservoir and the system is created during the process of quantum homogenization. We show that the information about the initial state of the system qubit is stored in the entanglement between the homogenized qubits.}

  abstract = {Can high energy physics be simulated by low-energy, non-relativistic, many-body systems, such as ultracold atoms? Such ultracold atomic systems lack the type of symmetries and dynamical properties of high energy physics models: in particular, they manifest neither local gauge invariance nor Lorentz invariance, which are crucial properties of the quantum field theories which are the building blocks of the standard model of elementary particles. However, it turns out, surprisingly, that there are ways to configure atomic system to manifest both local gauge invariance and Lorentz invariance. In particular, local gauge invariance can arise either as an effective, low energy, symmetry, or as an "exact" symmetry, following from the conservation laws in atomic interactions. Hence, one could hope that such quantum simulators may lead to new type of (table-top) experiments, that shall be used to study various QCD phenomena, as the confinement of dynamical quarks, phase transitions, and other effects, which are inaccessible using the currently known computational methods. In this report, we review the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories, and then describe our recent progress in constructing quantum simulation of Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions using ultracold atoms in optical lattices.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Every day, individuals use the Internet to communicate, gather information, and engage in commercial transactions. Encryption renders such activities secure and possible in the first place. While interest in encryption policy has fluctuated among policymakers for the past three decades, this paper argues for the need to promote strong encryption at a global level. The paper sheds light on the risks posed by quantum computing to national security, wherein breached encryption could compromise classified information, military intelligence, sensitive devices, and critical infrastructures. The argument for a worldwide encryption policy is further substantiated by the looming spectre of profound global power asymmetries. As the evolution of quantum technology remains concentrated within a select cohort of nations, those in possession of functional quantum computers could gain unprecedented advantages and exploit such technological supremacy. To buttress this assertion, this paper employs the logic of the `least trusted country problem' to underscore the fragility of global security in the face of such imbalances. In response, this paper introduces a three-fold strategy designed to pave the path towards a quantum-secure future. The strategy encompasses the pivotal elements of post-quantum cryptography, quantum key distribution, and quantum random number generators. While acknowledging the challenges inherent in implementing these measures, including the projected decade-long timeline for establishing standardized solutions, the paper underscores the urgency of confronting the imminent quantum computing menace in a proactive manner. By adhering to these strategic imperatives, the global community stands poised to reinforce encryption practices against the potent capabilities that quantum computing wields. In so doing, the security and integrity of information exchange can be preserved in an ever more interconnected world.},

  abstract = {Decoherence is caused by the interaction with the environment. Environment monitors certain observables of the system, destroying interference between the pointer states corresponding to their eigenvalues. This leads to environment-induced superselection or einselection, a quantum process associated with selective loss of information. Einselected pointer states are stable. They can retain correlations with the rest of the Universe in spite of the environment. Einselection enforces classicality by imposing an effective ban on the vast majority of the Hilbert space, eliminating especially the flagrantly non-local "Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger cat" states. Classical structure of phase space emerges from the quantum Hilbert space in the appropriate macroscopic limit: Combination of einselection with dynamics leads to the idealizations of a point and of a classical trajectory. In measurements, einselection replaces quantum entanglement between the apparatus and the measured system with the classical correlation.},

  abstract = {We analyze several product measures in the space of mixed quantum states. In particular we study measures induced by the operation of partial tracing. The natural, rotationally invariant measure on the set of all pure states of a N x K composite system, induces a unique measure in the space of N x N mixed states (or in the space of K x K mixed states, if the reduction takes place with respect to the first subsystem). For K=N the induced measure is equal to the Hilbert-Schmidt measure, which is shown to coincide with the measure induced by singular values of non-Hermitian random Gaussian matrices pertaining to the Ginibre ensemble. We compute several averages with respect to this measure and show that the mean entanglement of \$N {\textbackslash}times N\$ pure states behaves as lnN-1/2.},
